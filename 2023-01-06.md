The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) specify a minimal contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against adjacent colour(s) for text in general. An exception is made for large-scale text: It is considered easier to read and can therefore be set in a lower contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

Large-scale text is defined as:

Either bold text of at least 14 points (or 18.5 pixels).
Or regular text of at least 18 points (or 24 pixels).
