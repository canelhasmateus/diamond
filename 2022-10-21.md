Category 

* Set of objects that can relate to each other ( via morphisms ) in sensible ways , such as compoasition and associativity 



name | objects | morphism

set | sets | functions  
group | groups | group homorphisms 
top | topological spaces | continuous functions  
vectK | vector spaces over a field k | linear transformations 
MEAS | measurable spaces | measurable functions 
poset | Partially ordered sets | order preserving functions 
man | smooth manifold | smooth maps 


* mathematical objects are determined - and understood - by the network of relationships they enjoy with all the other objects of its species 



                    A category

* every good analogy is yearning to become a functor

Prime factorization 
* Achieve gret speed ups through wheel factorization
  " To produce numbers that are not multiples of two, we beging at three and keep adding two 
  to avoid multiples of boh two and three, we begin at five and alternatively add two and four
  "

* how tto generalize this behaviour ? For the 2,3,5 wheel: 
* find all values between 7 and 37 [ starting point, circunference + starting point ] that are not divisible by 2,3,5 
* In this case, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 32, 31, 37 
* their consecutive differences are 4,2,4,2,4,6,2,6 : this is the cycle taken to skip over non-primes

Feeling the need to implement a more useeful sistemaatic and automated way o learning and retaining knowledge
there are a lot of tools currently available or under consideration
1. evernote
2. feedly
3. graph-databases
4. brainscape
5. onedrive
6. obsidian
7. neovim

what would a high level view of such a system look like



```mermaid



IncomeStream -- 1a > Consume
IncomeStream -> Queue 
Queue -> Consume
Consume -> Archival 
Consume -> Annotation 
Annotation -> Rediscover
Archival -> Rediscover
Rediscover -> Consume



```

1a feedly 
1b ahk articles.csv 
1c akti, py + js 
1d articles.csv 
1e is implemented by limni, via foam + git 
1f and 1g can be implemented by akti 


Improvements 
1. 1b - reactive / scheduled updates for the portal 
2. 1c, 1e - some kind of system / triggr / discipline to deqeue 
3. 1d save htmls? preferebly already rendered 
4. 1g very lacking right now, really need a lot of things, such aas 
* pull together the raw and digested infos ( from roi and limni )
* better visualization / exploratioin 
    multiple pages for akti
    possibly graph-visualizations
5. NLP-summarization
* topics 
* keeywords
* redundancy of new information
6. exploration compass
* by relatedness , 
* by freshness 
* by 'should rediscover' time.

> Better utilization of the evernote web clipper 
Can nwe bring something of this sort back? such as markdown clipper, or whatever?


> What about outside chrome? mostly pdf, so a pdf reader with this kind of funtionaly would suffice ; great if this same thing could double as a bookshelf

maybe rediscover with aws wordcos or sumatra pdf?  and bring back to akti

>The consume part does not reliably produce annotations 
> The rediscover is inexisting 
still a problem 


About the archival: 

> What should i be archiving? 
> * bookmarks
> * images
> * pdfvideos

This is still aproblem.

> Clean Onedrie, evernote 

Still not 100%. There are still a bit of data scattered through onedrive, evernote, possibly obsidian.

Todo:

Vim Section Motion
Vim file type based motions 
Vim create 'to-*-case' motioin 
vim usemore pipe operator ( :! )
vim use moore operator pending mode 
vim investigate +- mottions 
vim investigate the difference between sentecs, paragraphs and sections 
move revisited annotations back to limni 

Mutation testing ( pit for JVM )
