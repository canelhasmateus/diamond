today is gonna be a good day
need to get used to this extend layer
i'll map some omre keys into altgr and the caps lock
    . Done the workspace ones.
    
possibly get started with the angle and wide mod
(wide mode in particularly seems very useful )

Need to consolidate my quick lists and macros:
Quick list for the run menu. ( Alt + s , Tab)
Make a quick list for the new file ( alt + m , ctrl + n )

Today i also made a bunch of quick lists for IJ , and started experimenting wih macros and micro plugins.


I also got a bit more used with the extend layer. 
 I genuinely want to experiment with the wide , angle,  and sym.
 
 Yesterday at night i was thinking about seting up some other mods.
 Such as dead-key-sticky modifiers.
    for example, `+shift would save this modifier , and release it along with the next key.
    Isn't this just a case of 'compose' key?
    or a  rev-compose?
