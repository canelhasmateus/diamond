This folder contains several list of articles and urls. 


* Bookmarks
  This contains a collection of "interesting" webpages. Things that i may find worthy of bookmarking, but don't necessarily fulfill any more specific function. 

* Resources
    These contain a collection of better curated webpages. Most of these were selected on the basis of asking myself the question: "Would i be confortable sharing or recommending these to another knowledge-seeking person?"


* Tools:
  contain a list of tools. These include code libraries, commercial tools  and  commerical enterprises. 

* Utilities : 
   contain a list of useful web-utilities. Most of these have  ready-to-use web interface, with very limited scope and functionality.

* Explore:
    Every time i come across a good article, i explore the author other posts. These are the list of authors that i haven't gone through their other works yet. 
    Can be Done, in which case i have already separated their interesting-to-me posts. Also, can be partial, which are authors for which i haven't gone through their whole body of publications, usually because they're big or not very bulk-access friendly.
