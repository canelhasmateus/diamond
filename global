        i certainly feel like my keyboard layout could be more ergonomic. 
        .. Angle Mod seems great
        .. Wide Mod seems great too.

        I certainly feel like alt+gr could be better used in my layout.

        current points of paint are:
            shift + c; ctrl + c
        
        keylogger stats maybe?
        Maybe i could expand this concept to not only typing.A Quantified Self
