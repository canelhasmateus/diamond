Use embeddings as input to a model.
There are better ways to do it than averaging

What would be the difference between markov chains and DFAs?

    . DFA's models the change in mode from a input perspective
    . Markov chain puts it in a more statistical perspective

Where does NFA's enter here? need to understand them better. 

"Markov Property: 
    The future state of the system is based only on the current state of the system"

entropy[

    a probability mass function is P : OMega -> [ 0 , 1] | sum(xeq) * p(x) = 1
]

the entropy is the value 

H( p ) = - Sum(  P(x) & log( p( x )))

"The amount of uncertainty in the value of the variable X"

It is readily apparent that given a compact set, the most entropic P is the uniform function. 


Relative Entropy 

Given Two probability mass functions P, Q, one defines the relative entropy of P with respect to Q ( Also called the Kullback-Leibler divergence ) as 



D( P || q ) =sum( p(x) * log( p( x ) / q( x ))


is quantity is often thought of in the following context: q is a prior probability distribution
(representing, say, the assumed state of the world), and p is the posterior distribution (after one has
learned something by interacting with the world). In this case, D(p k q) represents the amount of
information gained. Another operational definition: D(p k q) is the expected number of extra bits
needed to encode a sample from p given a code that was optimized for q

"The prototypical OO model brings in some new ways of solivng old problems, in an more dynamic and expressive way. It also presents new and more powerful mode3ls for extensibility and code-reuse - it does not however, give you contracts. There are no static guarantees that an object will alqways have a given set of properties ... "
