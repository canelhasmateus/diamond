http2
    
    multiplexing, stram priorities, hpack
        Every frame has its own number plus the stream number
            Can be sent in either direction interleaved with frames of other streams
                utilize as much of the tcp bandwidth as possible
        Stream Priorites and dependencies
            A stream can be assigned a weigth and a parent stream
                provides a means of telling the preferred order of data ingestion, optimized for rendering
                    necessary because otherwise, responses compete for bandwidth

    riginal sin of http:>
        Head of line Blocking
            Only one outstading http request per tcp connectin
                wasters time
        good idea to run a reverse proxy or cache like varnish behind your h2 layer in order to protect your application servers
            In http1, the HOL and the six connections per host resulted in a cooperative throttling
                No moroe than six simultaneous requests from any one colient
        
    possible problems
        using HAproxy is easy, but it silently introduces a new tcp buffer
            the cache spits out payload as quickly as possible, and the server sends data frames with the highest stream priority first
                The Load Balancer foils this, since, as long as its tcp buffer ius not completely filled, the lb will accept more data from the server : This quickly drains the server buffer, but from there on out, the priorization does not work anymore.

        HOL blocking
            Http2 solves the http head of line problem, it still suffers from tcp hol blocking : 
                tcp buffers are serialized fifos. this means that , once something is in that queue , you need to download it before going to the next one
                    .. Shouldn't multiplex solve this?

How Java immutables deal with memory allocation and gc pressure?

In most cases, when a holder object is updated to reference a different object, the new referent is a young object. If we update a MutableHolder by calling setValue(), we have created a situation where an older object references a younger one. On the other hand, by creating a new ImmutableHolder object instead, a younger object is referencing an older one.

The latter situation, where most objects point to older objects, is much more gentle on a generational garbage collector. If a MutableHolder that lives in the old generation is mutated, all the objects on the card that contain the MutableHolder must be scanned for old-to-young references at the next minor collection.

Control system 
    Root Locus Method

    System
        Known Parameters
        Unknown Parameter K
            Changing this affects poles
                Poles are the values of s that make the G(s) to blow up to infinity
    
    There are two questions here
        
        Design
            what value of K should we choose to meet my system performance requirements?

        Effect of variation
            What are the effect of a variation?
            How sensible is your system to slight deviations to k

        
    The S -plane is drawn in a x-y plane, with the real part in the x axis and the imaginary part in the Y axis. 
    Each location in the s plane correspond to a waveform in the time domain, characterized by e^st
        The left part of the plane cahacterizes exponential decay ; 
        the right part of the plane characterizes exponential growth;
        the vertical part characterizes the oscilation of the signal. 

    A system is characterized by both its zeroes and poles, but only the poles dictate the behaviour to unforced responses

    Don't make the demo look done
    The appearance of the presentation should reflect the level of polish-ness of the results. 
        "Its very possible that what you are dreaming of is simply not possbile"
        "When you build up expectations and you aren't able to meet them you look pretty silly"
    
    i think the keywords here are
        expectations
        assumptions

    managing them is good for both you and your peers. 
        "Show them something polished and pretty, and you'll get feedback on font sizes. The reviewers make incremental tweaks, blinded by  what is in front of them. But show a napkin sketch, and they don't just see what's there, they see what's possbile. you need to tell reviewers about the kind of feedback you do
        want at this stage. "
        "If you want big picture, make it fuzzy!"

One obvious force at work here is the visually engaging nature of beautiful imagery. I believe another, subtler issue is that people unintentionally calibrate their criticism according to their impression of where you are in the development process. A highly polished image may look like a screen shot of an implemented UI, or at least the result of many weeks' work, leading someone to assume that only small details can be changed at this point. Even if you repeatedly remind them that the design is just an early sketch, they may still demur from suggesting anything so bold as starting over. People may also have difficulty criticizing a design if the representation seems far beyond what they could have created themselves.

Type safety back and forth:
    Push Responsability forward with Maybe , but we can also push responsability back.
        . This is needed in order to provide totality in our functions
    
    When some piece of code hands us responsibility, we have two choices:
        Handle that responsaibility
        Pass it to someone else.
    
    Same thing as that "parse, don't validate"

Sampling methods

    Why 
        Approximate expectations
            Estimate Statistics 
            posterior inference ( compute probabilities)
        Visualization 
    

    Why expectations?
        Every probability is an expectation
        approximations are needed for sums and integrals
            most sums / integrals can be seem as expectations of some distribution. *

    Sampling methods
        Examples
            Monte carlo
            importance sequence
            sequecential importance sequence
        Pros: 
            Very easy to implement , when compared to exact inference        
            Very General Purpose
        Cons:
            Slow ( when compared to analytical methods)
                . Innapropriate for some problems
            Getting "good" samples may be difficult
                . ( What are good samples ? )
            Too Easy - Overused / used innapropriately
                . Not a cure all elixir.
