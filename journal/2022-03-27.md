 make triu behave different for arrays
 make triA , to loop All entries in matrix
 create a idx postfix for matrices.

 create a leetDfs template

 create a .edges matrix postfix

 pass my postfix templates to the plugin.

What recruiters really look for in a backend engineer

the hype trains usually die very quickly , around a year or two
    , learning it just to get hired means you're not passionate about that specific topic

    proxy / reverse proxy / load balancers
        . Layer 3 load balancers??

        pick a taste of different technologies, and see what goes down. 
    
    x
    go deep down in a stack
    find your passion
    talk about fundamentals the most you can 
    
    haproxy
        active - active?
        keep-alive?

    We can gain speed by focusing on object allocatins
        
        . Take all allocations and put them in a pile where you can see them
            .. Memory Profiling
            .. ( Derailed benchmarks)
        . COnsider each one: Does it spark joy? Keep only those.
            .. Useful
            .. Keeps your code clean
            .. does not cause performance problems
        
        . Why?
            "Malloc is slow"
        

    Can we replace allocation while maintaning correctness?


    Important to talk abou tstatistics and their impacts when talking about benchmarks. 
        . every time we measure a value, it could be because of randomness. 
        . check for statistical significance
            .. t 0test vs kolmogorov?

    There is a range of topics you need for the full picture: object slots, slot versus heap allocation, generational GC, incremental GC, compacting memory, fragmentation due to malloc implementation, etc. But for now, this simplification is good enough.

    Minimize object allocation.

How exactly does the whole 'core, process, variable, registers , slots and stacks' work?

    Process Control Block
        Process State 
        Process Number
        Process Counter
        Registers
        Memory Limits
        List of open files
        Signal Mask 
        CPU Scheduling info
    
    Since a process is entirely described by a pcb, whenever we wanna fork a process, essentially al we have to do is copy a parent control lblock to a child process control blcok.
