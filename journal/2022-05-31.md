I have fear that the cathartic pessimism we sometimes enjoy ironically is turning into a chronic fatalism. It's like a habit that has become an addiction.

There are a bunch of approaches that you can use to encode this into various type systems, so no one answer. The approach would change the name, one way would be phantom types.

Aside, I'd say this is a good topic for main.
The other thing I'd suggest is that correct by construction here isn't the right approach for many of the requirements.

Simply put a we're trying to apply static guarantees to non-static parts of a system (permissions could change any time, drive could fail, cosmic rays, ...).
Instead, I'd say effect handling is where the focus should be.
Whether a path is well formed can be asserted statically, but whether it is valid is dynamic in nature.

So do the happy action and for the dynamic aspects handle lack of permissions, missing file, io processing isn't total, and so on. Then handle those bits.
Simple approach is wrap this stuff in a try at least from a correctness point of view, think checked exceptions but less suck.

With structured concurrency approaches one could also tackle some/most of the liveness issues too.
Just my two cents
