database page splits

hd and ssd are built around blocks.
    -> When doing a read, you don't get to choose the amount you get. At minimum, you get 'BLOCK_SIZE'
        -> The same goes for writes.  Need to write in multiples of 'BLOCK_SIZE'

A page is a database abstraction.
    -> They not necessarily map 1 to 1 to blocks in the disk
    -> They are cached in buffer pools.
    -> When writing to that page, the database writes to the cache, buffering the disk flush.
        . It does so because any write to a page must be flushed to the disk in 'BLOCK_SIZE'. -> Multiple IO == Garbage collection on ssd

        . What about durability? -> Write Ahead Log

In a normal workload, we write to a page , until this page is "full". What happens if , after some time, we need to write to the middle of that page ( due to ordering / indexes )?
    . If there is no space, we have to split a page.
    . To deal with these splits, we usually let the pages only partially full ( say, 80%, depending on the database fillfactor ).
    . UUID primary keys are very likely to do this, since they're basically random.

When a page split occurs, what happens is index fragmentation: instead of occupying 1 page, it nows occupies 2 - which is bad because we must issue more logical reads / hard disk IO

when issuing writes to the o.s , it itself also caches / buffers the writes.
This doesn't fly for WAL in databases, because of durability - this means we must use fsync for WAL flushes.

what is the maximum number of tcp connections that a server can receive?
    A client can only have 65k connections to a server because of port reasons ( 16 bit )
    . This also applies for proxies and load balancers, since they are clients in regards to the backend serevr.

can layer 4 proxies use the http2 multi-channelling?

Virtual Router redundancy protocol
    . VIP
    . Implemented by KeepAlived

failover is a tech to switch to a redundant backup machine when one goes down.

active active and active passive are two configurations that can be used to achieve high-availability and proper load balancing
