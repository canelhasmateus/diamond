Raising e to the power of a matrix

useful to solve a class of differential equations
    . The world  is written in terms of diff equations
    . Very common in quantum phycics

What is the operation of e ^ M?
    . Not a way to multiply e itself multiple times
    . We take advantage of the power expansion of e < Taylor Series >:
        e^x = Sum( 1/n! * x^n )
    . We can use this to exponentiate a lot of objects, such as imaginary numbers and matrix, that do not seem immediatelly sensical as exponents
    . Discovery vs Invention

As we add more and more terms, we eventually reach a "constant" value.

What is this trying to do?

Two problems to matrix exponents.
    . Juliet and Romeo examples ( Loves me, Loves me not )
        .. dx / dt = - y( t )
        .. the general goal of edos is to find explicit forms of y(t), that satisfy the inteded behaviour, alongside its initial properties
        .. Makes sense to package these values as a point in cartesian space.
        .. The dx/dt here would be a"speed" vector that thugs this point to another location in space.
Matrices as linear transformations

"Rotation Matrices"
    . | Cos(T) - sin( T ) |
    . | sin(t) + cos( t ) |

Why can't this be done sooner
    . "Deeply understand the papraoch tou're taking, question it, find the gaps in your knowledge, and analyze the rists better so that you make an informative decision while moving faster. It doesn't ask yo reduce the orject quality or scope, its purely focused on undestanding the limitations.

There exists mulitple ways to split the work and deliver.
    . Technical design
    . Domain driven design
        .. Split problem into user joiurneys and business domain requirements instread of technical layers.

If we're able to answer "Because of the reason X and dependency Y that we have no toher choice", we're acting midfully.

Thinking in alternatives pushes us to focus on the problem rather than blidly loving the solution.

Moving fast and breaking things is good, but there are moments wetr risk-averse approach is better.
Military system, railway signaling, nuclear reactor software ....
Usually these system have ssafety critical properties, or they are difficult to roll back in failures...

Bias for action
"Many deicidions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study"

Use a principles-first approach to think about the architecture and the logic of the code; However, use an applications-first approach while plannin ght edeliveries.

Many software teams seen to use kanban , scrum or naother iterative process. but often, they fail to align their releases with their iterations.

Define whose responsability is waht.
    . WHen there is a sense of ownership, people take evcerything seriously. When there is a loosely defined resopnsibility, it creates confusion and conflicts. Every action should have a directly responsible individual.

    Bruing just enough clarity to the future. 

Accept, aknowledge mistakes.
    With bias to action, you will have many mistakes.

As a leader, transform "thing i like to do" into "things we like to do"

Decision making pendulum

#

Getting lost in the decision making process
     Leaders either use:

     A lot of authority,

     Seek consensus

More often than not, they stick to one deicision making style for everyhthin => conflicts can haapen and the inflexivility in decision making is at the root fo vairous problems,

There are different sizes of decisisions;

Authroity is detrimental to everyone:
    When leaders givce commands in every decision, they include themselsves everywhere while preventings others from growing
    by veing involved in everything, they become blockers.

Relying in consnesus is a process that takes a long time.

"Consent decision making"
    . Instead of getting an "I agree", it looks to just not having any objections.

    . Looks more promising, but the more robusdt streategy is having the flexibility to se all of the above together. 

![](2022-04-02-16-18-23.png)

Each person style is different.
    .. Affected by personality, backgrounds, and previous work environemnts.
    . When confronted with a decision style that its not accustomed to , the indifvidual feels uncomfortable and gets annoyed by the approach.
    . When this happens, they m ight say "we're going to fast'
    . This is a leader's mistake. its a communications failure
        .. wrongful focus on speed vs correct action.

How to choose each one?
    . .Experience
    . Empathy,
    . Reading the air
    . Understanding circumstances.
Explaining the decision making satyle is preffered
    . Discussions never end without understadning the reasoning.

Bias torwards action while keeping the authority at the minimum.

Can't i schedule daily jobs to deal with my readlist?

lets try sketching something right now.
