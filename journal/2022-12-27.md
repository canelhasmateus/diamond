What t√¥ learn and why
Mwtalearning why what and how
What: the expert interview method
What: facts,  concepts,  procedures
Concepts are understood
Facts are memorized
Procedures need t√¥ be practiced
Why: intrisic vs instrumental
How: benchmarking vs emphasize exclude method
Benchmarking
Find how things are usually done and use it as default
Universities are good for benchmarking
Emphasize exclude
Find some benchmark , and start doing modifications when you have knowledge of what is important
Omit or delay things not important
10% rule: use 10% of your expected learning time doing research
Be Aware of the marginal improvements of meta vs actual learning and vice versa, recalibrate often
