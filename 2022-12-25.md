One of the biggest breakthroughs in math came from stopping looking at things as objects and thinking in terms of properties

* Instead of askings what *is* a vector, we should ask what *can we do* with vectors

1. Add vectors
2. Multipy by scalers

( Form linear combination s- spans and basis )

Thus, a vector is anything that can be added and scale that
follows these 8 rules:

...

1. Summation Associativity
2. Commutativity
3. Existence of Identity under sum
4. Inverses under sum
5. Scalar Multiplication Associativity
6. Existence of Identity under Multiplication
7. Scalar multiplication Distributivity
8.

> A vector is a element of a Linear Space

Geometric Algebra is a incredible powerful branch of mathematics that extends the usual operations on numbers to geometric shapes.

natural way to transform geometric problems into algebraic ones

History:

Back in the 1800 many algebraic systems popped upp - vector algebra came up on top . It can describe many things, but it is not enough in some situations
many people  started tacking new math ideas, but resulted i a massive kludge of math ideas.   --> Geo Algebra as a solution

 hello, world

 what is the simpleset object that we can ndo algebra with?
