Coroutines

Separate from  generators

Generators abstract iteration of values
Coroutine abstract consumption of values

Generators pull data through the pipe with iteration
Coroutines push data into the pipeline with send

Coroutines and state machines

Multitasking is implemented by the Operational System.
    Usually by means of Either Interrupts or Traps
    yield is a trap

Ops Works
    Stack
    . A set of instances that you want to manage collectivelly, because they have a common purpose.
    . Handles tasks that apply to the group of instances as a whole, such as manging applications and cookbooks.
    Layer
        . A component of a stack.
        . Each layer in a stack must have at least one instance
        . Each instance in a stack must be a member of at least one layer.
    Recipe
        . ????

Ec2
    SPot
        . Discount for unused capacity.
        . Stateuless, fault-tolerant or flexible applications
        . highly integrated with other aws services
    Fargate
        . Servierless compute engine for containers
        . Works with both ECS and EKS
    ECS
        . Shared state, optimistic ocncurrency system
        .  When launched with the fargate launch type, has its own isolation boundary and does share kernel and resources.

Disaster Recovery

    - Backup and restore (RPO in hours, RTO in 24 hours or less): Back up your data and applications using point-in-time backups into the DR Region. Restore this data when necessary to recover from a disaster.

- Pilot light (RPO in minutes, RTO in hours): Replicate your data from one region to another and provision a copy of your core workload infrastructure. Resources required to support data replication and backup such as databases and object storage are always on. Other elements such as application servers are loaded with application code and configurations, but are switched off and are only used during testing or when Disaster Recovery failover is invoked.

- Warm standby (RPO in seconds, RTO in minutes): Maintain a scaled-down but fully functional version of your workload always running in the DR Region. Business-critical systems are fully duplicated and are always on, but with a scaled down fleet. When the time comes for recovery, the system is scaled up quickly to handle the production load.

- Multi-region (multi-site) active-active (RPO near zero, RTO potentially zero): Your workload is deployed to, and actively serving traffic from, multiple AWS Regions. This strategy requires you to synchronize data across Regions.

    Backup and Restore -> Pilot Light -> Warm StandBy -> Multi-Region

    "The difference between pilot light and warm standby can sometimes be difficult to understand. Both include an environment in your DR region with copies of your primary region assets.  However, the pilot light cannot process requests without additional action taken first, while warm standby can - although sat reduced capacity levels.

VPC Peering connections allow access to part of the CIDR block, a specific CIDR block or a specific instance within the peer vpc.

I realize that often, i miss these question because i'm too focused on the "what", and slip on the 'how'.
