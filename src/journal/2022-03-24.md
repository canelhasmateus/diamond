game theory

    game value

    a game 
        set of action for each player ( finite or infinite, not necessarily simetrical ) and a payoff function for each possible choice of actions.
        The result of the payoff is called utility.
        In games in chich the utility is always "one playert gains exactyl the utility lost by the other playe " are called zero-sum.

        When there are finite choices, we can analyze then as a matrix. 

        a strategy is a algorithmn that receives the data of the current game ( no history ) and outputs an action. 

        when the best course is to choose the same action no matter what your oponent does , we call it a dominating strategy. 
        when the optimal strategy requires a player to act randomly, according to distributions, we call these mixed strategies. 
    
    minimax theorem
        every two player zero-sum game has a optial strategy for each player (possibly randomized).
        note that it isn't necessarily the best if your oponent is being dumb , but it maximizes your values without special knowledge or space to store information about past play. 

        the expected utility for player 1 when both players play a miniman strategy is called "value of the game" , and is a unique number. 
        
        finite games and well-behaved continuous ones can be solved by linear programming. 
    
    What is measure ? ( measure theory )
