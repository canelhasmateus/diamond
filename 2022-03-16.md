    better auto hotkeys usage


prefix trees and monte-carlo trees 
    ( exploration and explotation )
    i though about this when thinking about the process of learning a new keyboard layout configuration
    we start pecking, a single key
    when getting better, we start to type more and more advanced sequences, starting with doubles, them syllables, then entire words and phrases. 

    this process of getting deeper into this prefix tree of sequences reminds me of monte-carlo-tree-searching.

    What would be the parallels here? what would be exploration and explotation?
    its very fun to do it guitar hero style, with a music in the background.
