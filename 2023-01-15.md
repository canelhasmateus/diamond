Depth of knowledge, and transfer demand.

* when students have strategize or use creative, extended thinking to tackle a task, we say that the task requires high *depth of knowledge*
* When students have to combine familiar facts, procedures, and concepts in unfamilliar ways or situations, we say that the task has far *transfer demand*.

Ther agic in these tasks comes from their unfamiliarity -> links to ultranlearning exploration stuff

Chunking -. George MIller introduces the term to describe `the level of granularity which is perceived as a single unit`.  Two people might chunk information at different levels.

Matery learning suggests that instead of moving though a curriculum with a fixed pace , classes should support students in moving at whatever pace allows them to thoroughly grasp the material before them.

Repetition changes the nature of tasks with high depth of knowledge or far transfer demand -> links with the  concept of `proceduralization` by ultran learning .

"Narrated explorables"

)))

<https://andymatuschak.org/books/>

"At least for non-fiction books, one implied assumption at the foundation: people absorb knowledge by reading sentences"
...
As a medium, books are surprisingly bad at converyin knowledge, and readers mostly don't realize it.
...
Books don't work for the same reason that lectures don't work: neither medium has any explicit theory of how people actually learn things, and as a reasult, both mediums accidently ( and mostly invisibly ) evolved around a theory that's plainly false.
...
if we collect enough of these underlying "truths", some shared themes might emerge, suggest a more coherent theory of how learning happens - we'll call such theoriies `cognitive models`.
...
In learning theories we call this model `trasmissionism`. It is the notion that knowledge can be directly transmitted from teacher to student, like transcibing text from one page onto another.
... when books do work, it's generallyfor readers who deploy skillful metacognition to engage effectively with the books's ideas .... textboots do more to help, but they still foist most of the metacognition onto the reader, and they ignore many important ideas about how people learn.

... but it is also possible that we'll never discover the insights we need while tethered to the patterns of thought implicit in this medium ...
