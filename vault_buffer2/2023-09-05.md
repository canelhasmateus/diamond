Reading Technique vs Strategy

- on harder texts, strategy is better

Technique

- Sub-vocalisation  -> Reduces cognitive loading, helps process complex information quickly.
  We don't want to subvocalize on places that are harder.
- Group words
  reading a bit more relax-y , allows for the central-vision to be wider. This makes it easier to group words
- Heterogeneous
  Bursts of speed where it is possible
- Pauses
  Visualise/ connect to the big picture. Predict where it is going to take you next.

`Transfer-Appropriate processing`

- How you should initially encode information depends on how you're going to
  use it in the future.  "In a recall test, with pair of associated words, we
  can try different approaches:
  1. Focus on the relationship between cue and target
  2. Focus on the relationship between targets, creating groups When doing
     the first one, free recall becomes harder. Cued recall becomes harders when
     practicing the second one. "
- This is why realistic, applied practice early on the learning process can
  improve learning. Knowing what you're going to do with the information helps
  in choosing an appropriate encoding strategy

Students often confuse `recognition` for `recollection`

- This is what usually happens when doing highlighting
