# InformationProcessingTheory

The consolidation of long term memory happens through a process,
simplified below:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2

    SENSORIAL --> WORKING : attention
    WORKING --> WORKING : rehersal
    WORKING --> LONG_TERM : encoding
    LONG_TERM --> WORKING : recall

    SENSORIAL --> FORGOTTEN: immediate
    WORKING --> FORGOTTEN: seconds to minutes
    LONG_TERM --> FORGOTTEN: hours to mounts
```

Of note, two practices are most important:

1. [[Encoding]]
2. [[Recall]], which is impacted by the way it was encoded.

Notice also that [[Forgetting]] is *not* a passive process.
Your brain tries to actively forget everything it does not use.
