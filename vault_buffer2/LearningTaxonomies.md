# LearningTaxonomies

There are several kinds of classifications and taxonomies for learning and knowledge. E.g.

## Bloom

[[BloomTaxonomy]] tries to create a set of language for discussing learning
outcomes.  It divides learning into three low levels and three high level tiers
of learning. Each tier is defined by the way in which the student uses the
knowledge.

For example, In the first tier, the student should be able to recite
back fact-based knowledge, without necessarily understanding it.
At higher levels, he should be able to contrast, and even synthesize new information.

## Solo

[[SoloTaxonomy]] creates a set of tier that is not based in outcomes, but in
relationships, and in the way that the student is able to grasp the relationship
between the different concepts.

## Conclusions

Between all these systems, there is a concordance that - Isolated stuff belongs
to lower levels of understanding, while higher levels of understanding require
the grasp of a more interconnected reality. [^1]
