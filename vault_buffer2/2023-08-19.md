different methods of prioritization

- Eisenhower matrix

  ```
          | urgent      | not urgent
  ```

\---           | ---         | ---\
important     | DO IT TODAY | SCHEDULE A TIME TO DO IT
not important | DELEGATE    | ELIMINATE

- Doctors learn a different one:

\---                      | triage by severity | how much time is this going to take
consequences of failure  | ...                | ...

if consequences of failure are so low as to be below an minimal threshold,
dont do that thing.

Doing things other than studying or working that energises you
Multitasking in some situations to get more things done.
