[Myths About Efficiency (Why Busy People Have More Free Time) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0yZPaJddLU)

When you want too much out of life, either you drop priorities and sacrifice ,
or get a bigger plate

> The will to power
> People are not driven by pursuit of happiness, the want to avoid pain or loss.
> It is now always based on survival. People will put themselves under
> voluntary misery; The sense of fulfilment and satisfaction with life is to live
> you life along this `Will to power`

- The ability to live in the way you want to live, live the ilfe you want to
  live, and being the person you want to be.

Without a higher level of efficiency, you don't get to do any of that, you
can't have everything that you want; Its not about how much you want on your
plate, it is the fact that it is not big enough.

[Aiming for Long term Goals can Increase Failure | E4 Bigger Plate - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFNhVf66MbU)

Anchoring yourself to your nearest / ultimate goal. -> Concrete: "Be a really
good cardiologist". Tangible, Specific.
What would it take to get there? the steps along the way : yearly; monthly
steps. At the end of the month, how would you know that you're closer or not?

It is very difficult. Is is hard to know, at the small scale. Thus, we usually
track ourselves with bigger goals -> Comparing  to a version  of yourself that
is far-removed from the current context.

It is very difficult to know the necessary steps required to take you where you
wan tto go, which is way it makes very little sense to measure yourself this
way.

Measuring based on outcomes is a very frustrating proposition. It is very
binary ( either you get or you don't )

'What is the type of person that would achieve that outcome' can work better in
these cases, as it provides a set of traits that can be measurably improved
upon.
e.g. "It would take a very balanced person -> I should sleep more / better sleep schedule"

> Inversion

> Better yet, if you have long term goals, work backwards so you can make
> better short term goals that help you get to those longer term goals and
> measure your progress accurately so you know whether you're actually
> accomplishing those short term goals and if you need to change those goals
> after careful introspection and hypothesis testing with good data gathering
> that is relevant to the result instead of the effort It's actually about not
> glamourizing the goals, and not being fixed in the path of doing what your
> meant to do. Instead adopting traits of the person who will find the tasks
> and your goals as a part of their journey and will have an easier time doing
> things. Glamourizing things such as "How many hours I am putting in" is
> always going to lead you astray and towards being unhappy because it never
> feels enough.

[4 Steps to Read Difficult Texts Faster (Academic Speed Reading Comprehension) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1k4eXELEIE)

Reading Technique vs Strategy

- on harder texts, strategy is better

Technique

- Sub-vocalisation  -> Reduces cognitive loading, helps process complex information quickly.
  We don't want to subvocalize on places that are harder.
- Group words
  reading a bit more relax-y , allows for the central-vision to be wider. This makes it easier to group words
- Heterogeneous
  Bursts of speed where it is possible
- Pauses
  Visualise/ connect to the big picture. Predict where it is going to take you next.

4. Be strategic with your resources
   Aim at self-regulated learning

Never compromise on the non-negotiables

> Are you really wanting help? Or are you just wanting validation for why it's hard for you?
