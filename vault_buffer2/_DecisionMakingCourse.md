The steering wheel for your life

- The way your life turns out depends on only two things: luck and the quality
  of your decisions. You can only control one of these, which is why decision
  making is the most valuable skill that you can learn. It's the way that you
  can give yourself the best possible edge in life. Good decision making
  compounds over time. Imagine taking a long journey to the Moon, perhaps.
  Being off by a tiny amount doesn't seem like such a big deal at first, but
  over the course of a long journey, you'll end up in a completely different
  spot from where you intended to go. Decision skills are the steering wheel
  for your life. The quality of your decisions matters, and it matters more and
  more over time. I'm so excited that you've chosen to improve yours.

A map of decision-making

- What is decision intelligence? It's the discipline of turning information
  into better action at any scale and in any setting. It's an update to the
  decision making conversation for the modern era. Since these days,
  information has gotten complicated. If you strive for excellence in decision
  making, you can't afford to ignore the conversation around data. But that
  doesn't mean that you need to be the smartest data scientist in the room.
  Instead, you need to understand how to work with various kinds of experts and
  how to leverage today's technology in your decision making. In other words,
  you need a map of how all the components of decision making fit together so
  that you can reach your potential as a data-driven leader. So where is that
  map? Unfortunately, society has traditionally treated decision making like
  something that, well, just happens, rather than exactly what it is, a bit of
  an art, a lot of the science, and a skill that you can get better at. That's
  why the course that you've been hoping for hasn't been made before, well,
  before this one that is. In the past, if you were interested in improving
  your decision skills and learning the everything of decision making, you
  would've had to go and scrounge around in a bunch of different disciplines
  the way that I had to. What I'm doing for you is putting that all together so
  that you'll be able to learn in one place. Now, this course is just making a
  start. You won't learn the everything of decision making in your first
  course, but I hope that this is the start of your excitement for learning as
  much as you possibly can about being the best decision maker that you can be.
  As a society, we need an urgent attitude adjustment. In today's
  interconnected world, individual decisions have an unprecedented opportunity
  to affect others, for better or worse. As we enlarge ourselves with
  technology, it becomes easier to accidentally step on the people around us,
  which is why we have more responsibility than ever before to steer our
  decisions thoughtfully.

The most important lesson in decision-making

- I am so happy that you're watching this video, because if you watch just this
  one and none of the others, frankly, that's okay; this is the most important
  one. We're going to cover the most important concept in decision analysis,
  the difference between a decision and an outcome and why outcome bias is such
  an important thing to watch out for, why a good decision maker avoids outcome
  bias, and why outcome bias, unfortunately, is one of society's favorite forms
  of mass irrationality. So first, what is a decision? It's more than a choice
  between options. It is an irrevocable allocation of resources. Now, those
  resources might be money or physical actions. It might also be giving up an
  opportunity. So you might be able to choose between two things, and it costs
  you nothing to do that. But once you choose one, the opportunity to choose
  the other one goes away. So that's an irrevocable allocation of resources. An
  opportunity is a resource too. What is an outcome? An outcome is something
  different from a decision. An outcome is how things turn out later. So it's
  possible to make a good decision and have an outcome that's not so good as a
  result. So let's take a look at an example. Imagine that we're playing a
  little game, and at the beginning you have a choice, a decision to make. Are
  you going to play the game with the coin and ignore the die? Or are you going
  to play the game with the die and ignore the coin? Here's how the coin game
  works. This is a coin that has yes and no rather than heads and tails. And if
  the coin comes up yes after I flip it, then you'll get $100, zero otherwise.
  Meanwhile, with the die, if it lands on a six, you will get $100, zero
  otherwise. So you have the choice between the game involving the coin and the
  game involving the die. If you think the coin is the better game, you're
  right. This should be a no-brainer. You have 50% chance to win. That's one
  out of two options. So 50% to win, and here you have only a one out of six
  chance to win. The coin is clearly superior. Good choice, great decision that
  you made there. Now imagine this plays out and we get to see the outcomes.
  And unfortunately, we were unlucky. The coin comes up with a no and the die
  comes up with a six. In that situation, bad outcome if you played on the
  coin. You would've had a good outcome if you played on the die, even though
  your decision was a great decision. But if you're reacting to this with like,
  "Oh no, I should have played the game with the die," no, no, absolutely not,
  you shouldn't have. You made a great decision by picking the coin. The die
  would've been the bad decision. And the danger here is if you're sensitive to
  outcomes if you show outcome bias, then you're going to learn the wrong
  lesson here, and next time you'll play the die game instead of the coin game.
  With a fair die and a fair coin, you should play the coin game every time.
  And in the long run, you will end up having more great outcomes than bad
  ones. But if you learn the wrong thing from this situation where you had an
  unlucky outcome, you might end up choosing the die, choosing the worst
  decision next time. Don't be oversensitive to that outcome. An outcome has
  two components, the quality of the decision that went into it and randomness.
  Think of that as luck. Luck isn't something you have any control over. But in
  many complex situations in life, there is that randomness component. If all
  you observe is the outcome and you don't get to see anything about what was
  known at the time that the decision was made, then you'll end up either
  punishing or rewarding people for a combination of luck and decision ability.
  And you don't know how much of that is luck. Maybe most of it is luck. So the
  people that you promote, the people that you put on a pedestal, are they
  simply lucky or are they making good decisions?

The dangers of outcome bias

- Imagine if I played this game in front of you and when I ended up getting
  this no and six result, you held that against me and you clamored for me to
  be fired and replaced with a decision maker that has a spotless track record
  who has never lost that opportunity to get a hundred dollars. Well, one of
  two things would be true about them in this situation. Either they've been
  lucky. Do look up survivorship bias when you get a moment. Luck isn't
  something you can bank on, or they're simply less experienced than me.
  Someone who's never played this game before would never have had a bad
  outcome. Always evaluate decisions based only on what was known at the time
  that decision was made. And I know this goes against intuition. I know this
  goes against what a lot of people say when, say, policy decisions are made.
  People say, "Oh, let's just see how things turn out before we judge it." You
  don't need to see how things turn out. You need to see what was known at the
  time that decision was made. That's how you judge whether it was a good
  decision. If you hold things that people couldn't possibly have known against
  them, that's like penalizing decision makers for not having a crystal ball,
  neither fair nor particularly smart in terms of evaluating decision ability.
  Now, here is a really uncomfortable thing. Getting a true account from
  someone who didn't document their decision process becomes less likely with
  each passing minute. Even if you think about some of the important decisions
  you've made in your own life, if you didn't write anything down about what
  you knew at that time, and now all you get to observe is outcomes, you'll
  learn the wrong lessons from your own decisions. You'll forget what you knew
  and what you learned later. A lot of things will make sense in hindsight, and
  you'll forget that you didn't actually know that information right then.
  That's called hindsight bias. The only true way to assess a decision is to
  look at precisely what was known at the time that decision was made and how
  that information was treated and integrated. So you'll ask yourself, which
  factors did this decision maker actually consider? How did they go about
  gathering their information? Which information sources did they use? Did they
  get the right amount of information based on what was at stake with that
  decision? That's what you'll want to look at. But if no one's writing
  anything down, there's no way to assess the quality of the decision makers
  that you surround yourself with, and it's very hard for you to personally
  grow as a decision maker. So the big lesson of this video, you need
  documentation of the decision process. So put more effort into this. That's
  how you guarantee that you're able to pull apart the role of luck and the
  role of good decision making in your life and learn the right lessons and not
  the wrong lessons from what happens to you.

Why are some decisions so difficult?

- What makes some decisions more difficult than others? Well, a lot of things.
  So let's start with options. When there are fewer options to choose between
  that decision is simpler. As you add more options and particularly,
  combinations of options, you start getting into compound decision making. So
  the fewer options you have, the easier it is and if it's just one yes or no
  with one round, that's the easiest possible thing. Another situation that is
  super simple is the obvious winner kind of decision. Would you rather eat a
  rock or an apple? I don't know, that one for me has an obvious winner. Two
  different kinds of apple? That one is a little bit harder, though, of course
  if the decision has low stakes, that is also easy. Clear objectives is
  another one. Have you thought about the right way to make the decision?
  And is it easy to come up with the criteria by which you'd want to make
  them? Low cost is another one and there are different types of costs. The
  cost of making the decision, how hard is it actually to evaluate the
  information? Low cost of executing. How difficult is it to carry out the
  decision? And then of course, the cost of making the mistakes. How
  expensive are the mistakes? When all those things have low cost that is
  an easier decision. Then reversibility. Technically, we're defining
  decisions as those situations where you have an irrevocable allocation of
  resources. So decisions are not reversible but you'll find in various
  kinds of literature this concept of a reversible decision. That is, you
  have take-backsies. If you can with minimal effort or minimal cost
  reverse your decision or pivot, then there are not such big consequences
  to getting it wrong and it becomes an easier decision again. Then
  cognitive. Is the decision very taxing on your cognitive functions? Does
  it require a lot of effort? Are you holding a lot of things in memory? Is
  it difficult to perform the decision task while you're distracted? Well,
  if the answer is yes, that's a harder decision. If this is something that
  you can do well and consistently well, no matter how much other stuff
  is going on, that's an easier decision. Does this decision trigger
  you emotionally? What's the emotional valence here? If it doesn't
  affect anything emotional for you, that's an easier decision than one
  that gets you into a highly wound up state. Similarly, if there's low
  pressure and low stress, that's an easier decision than one under
  high pressure and high stress. Ah, now we get to information. Do you
  have full and reliable information instantly available to you? If
  yes, that is an easier decision than where you are dealing with
  partial information and probability. As we'll see in the Upgrades
  chapter when we talk about statistics, having less information makes
  things worse, not better. no risk and no ambiguity make a decision
  easier. Risk and ambiguity are different concepts. Ambiguity is when
  you don't even know the probabilities. Risk is when you're making a
  gamble but at least you know how that gamble works. Another element
  that can make decision making harder is timing. Either because the
  timing conflicts with other decisions you might need to be making at
  the same time, or because you might not have as much time as you
  would like to make the decision. Where there might, for example, be a
  lot of pressure to come up with an answer very quickly. Then a
  decision made in isolation is easier. And this is a little preamble
  for our third section on group decisions. When you are the only
  person involved in that decision, when the decision process
  doesn't involve anybody else, no one else is watching, and when
  the consequences of the decision don't affect anybody else, well,
  that one is much easier than where you are in a social setting.
  Social effects like scrutiny, social consequences, taking other
  people's preferences and opinions into account, affecting other
  people, having your reputation on the line all make things
  harder. And then internal conflicts. Things like a conflict of
  incentives between your desire to play outside and study for an
  exam. Those conflicts will make it harder to make the decision
  than if there weren't any internal conflicts and all incentives
  related to the decision were aligned. And then finally,
  adversarial effects. Where there are other people who are playing
  against you, who are competing with you, those decisions tend to
  be harder than decisions that are cooperative or made in
  isolation. So that was a big old laundry list. What was the point
  of going through that? It's certainly not an exhaustive list, but
  it tells you about some of the factors, one, that researchers in
  decision making might study when they think about complex versus
  simple decision making. And it's also a list for you of warnings
  to pause, slow down, and reevaluate where you have an important
  decision and some of the characteristics that make that decision
  difficult. You might want to take a bit more time, maybe seek
  some help, maybe get a second opinion on it or get an expert to
  help you out instead of rushing headlong into it. When a decision
  has all the characteristics of being easy then you might be able
  to approach it with more confidence. Though a second opinion is
  usually a good idea when you're dealing with a high stakes
  decision.

How to set goals

- So if there is an app that promises to make all your decisions for you, ah,
  run the other way and don't take kindly to charlatans. So this particular
  framework is about goal setting and what to think about in what order. So
  before you can get to setting goals what you need to think about first is
  your priorities and opportunities. There's no point in setting goals if
  they're completely unaligned with your opportunities. But there's even less
  point if you don't know what your priorities are. That's how you're going to
  misspend your resources including your time, attention, effort, and money of
  course. To come up with your priorities think about which priorities many
  other people have are simply non priorities for you. You don't really care
  about them. That will help you whittle down a whole lot of the options and
  focus on what actually is important to you. So ask yourself these things that
  other people care about. Do I care about it also? How much do I care about
  it? And when you're left with your short list of priorities 'cause you know,
  the list could be infinitely long you want to focus on really the main ones.
  Do look at them side by side, this one versus that one. What is more
  important to me. Now, just priorities won't get you to goal. So you also need
  to think about what your opportunities actually are. And when it comes to
  setting goals there are two classic mistakes and you might make them
  simultaneously. And that is having goals that are too concrete and having
  goals that are too vague. When your goals are too vague it's very easy to
  deprioritize 'em. When your goals are too concrete it's too easy to over
  focus and follow that goal and actually harm your wellbeing in the process.
  So the trick is to have layers of goals that serve different purposes for
  you. So to wrap our heads around this, let's rummage around in the jargon of
  the managerial sciences and borrow some terms that will help direct our
  thinking. Let's look at three different kinds of goals, outcome goals,
  performance goals, and process goals. And it's wise to think in terms of all
  three when you structure your goal setting. So what is an outcome goal? An
  outcome goal is the win that you're actually interested in. And that might
  actually be a vague goal. It might be hard to measure. It might be heavily
  influenced by factors entirely outside your control. So an example of an
  outcome goal might be to be as healthy as possible this year. Not fully in
  your control. Kind of vague. What does it mean to be healthy? How would we
  even measure that? So it's hard to manage a goal that you can't measure. So
  we need another layer. A performance goal is a goal that is measurable and if
  realistic, mostly under your control. So perhaps a performance goal might be
  to run five miles in under 45 minutes. Now if you are already frequently
  running that fast that's rather under your control. But if you've never run
  at that speed, that is aspirational, something that'll motivate you. But it
  may be quite hard to manage that at any level of granularity. So that's why
  we're going to need a process goal. A process goal is a goal that is
  measurable and if realistic, fully under your control. So your process goal
  might be to run for 45 minutes every other day. So we're not talking about
  speed, we're not talking about a good performance here. All you have to do is
  run at whatever speed you can, whatever distance you can for 45 minutes every
  particular period. And that will be very easy for you to track your progress
  on. And that gives you a process to follow. Whereas that performance goal is
  that aspirational North Star that helps you stay motivated. But what you're
  actually interested in that's much more closely aligned to your priorities is
  that outcome goal. Just do be careful. Never allow your process goal to take
  over as the most important thing. Remember that your process goal is there to
  serve your outcome goal. And if it stops being useful to your outcome goal,
  get rid of it. Change your process goals. So one way in which you might harm
  yourself rather than help yourself is, for example, if by running for 45
  minutes every other day you end up hurting your knees and your doctor says to
  you, stop running. This is really bad for your knees. And you insist that
  you've got this process goal you have to run for 45 minutes every other day
  or else. Well, at that point, you're harming your outcome goal because if you
  permanently damage your knees that's not great for your overall health. So
  it's by having these different layers of goals that you're able to keep
  everything aligned to your priorities. Also give yourself a North Star to
  chase and a process that you can track and control. So set goals wisely by
  having a little bit more granularity and layering in your thinking.

Intuition and the value of clairvoyance

- Let's talk about the value of clairvoyance. (light whimsical chiming) No, not
  psychic powers, and that kind of clairvoyance. The value of clairvoyance is a
  concept from decision analysis, which will help you think about how much
  effort, information, data to put towards your decision. The principle here is
  that a good decision maker doesn't overspend or underspend on a decision.
  There's no need to have perfectionism on low value decisions. Likewise, on
  high value decisions, don't underspend resources. Put an adequate amount of
  effort towards them. So how do you approach your decision making? First, it's
  worth doing a little bit of visualization about what sorts of reasonable
  best, and reasonable worst case scenarios could come out of your decision
  just to get a sense of what you're dealing with. Then once you've oriented
  yourself, time for the value of clairvoyance, simple exercise, but very, very
  helpful. Here's what you do. You imagine that you have access to some kind of
  psychic who can tell the future, and they will tell you exactly the perfect
  answer for your decision. They will help you make the best possible decision.
  The best possible choice among your options. What is the most in terms of
  maybe it's money, maybe it's time, effort, other resources that you would put
  towards getting that answer. So if you could have perfect clarity, perfect
  information, perfect data about your decision, and you know for sure you made
  the best possible choice, what would that be worth to you? At most. Now, when
  you find that the value isn't very high, you will want to use intuition and
  go with your gut to get it done quickly. I mean, look, if I'm choosing
  between what to eat for lunch today, I shouldn't be spending an entire day of
  a PhD trained statistician's time on this question. I should just get it done
  with intuition. Accessing your intuition though, is a pretty quick thing. So
  making decisions intuitively, you just go with your gut. Straightforward,
  simple. Where does intuition make sense? Well, of course, with low value
  decisions, just get it done. As we'll see in a later video on prioritization
  and decisiveness, you simply don't have the time and energy to make every
  decision perfectly, so you're going to have to pick and choose your battles.
  Don't overspend your effort where the stakes are really low. That said, if
  you are a student of decision making, there is one good reason to approach
  low value decisions carefully, and that is not for the decision itself, but
  to grow your skills as a decision maker. What you don't want in your life is
  for you to face a really important decision, and this is the very first time
  that you are trying to take a formal, careful approach to it. Practice
  makes perfect. So practice where the stakes are low. That's why you'll
  see some students of decision-making approaching some fairly low stakes
  things quite pedantically, again, like choosing between salads at lunch.
  Intuition also makes more sense when you have the following factors. One
  is time pressure. When you have not much time, even if you'd love to take
  a formal approach, sometimes you can't and you have to go with intuition.
  Expertise is a great factor in favor of intuition where you have
  expertise, because you've made decisions like this already, and you're in
  a similar kind of setting, intuition makes sense. Whereas if you find
  yourself in a completely different context, don't expect your gut to know
  anything about that. Don't trust it. Likewise, where the decision is
  unstructured, questions like, is this a good piece of art? What does that
  even mean? How do we think about operationalizing good art? And yet
  people can kind of approach judging art in an unstructured way, often.
  Intuition makes sense for that, and of course, you'll want expertise
  there too. I imagine that someone from the 17th century might have a hard
  time judging contemporary art. Now, to summarize this section, let's flip
  it around. Where should you put more effort in? Where you have plenty of
  time? Where the decision is really important? Where you lack expertise
  and experience making decisions kind of like this one. And where the
  decision lends itself to structure. So when I play cards, for example, I
  play some card games where calculating the probabilities helps, and as a
  trained statistician, I know how to do that in my head. We find me
  winning a little more often than some of the friends I play with that are
  going with pure intuition. Go figure. To summarize this video, a good
  decision maker does justice to what's at stake. Think about the value of
  your decision and think about the value of clairvoyance. What would be
  the maximum amount of resources that you would put towards a perfectly
  executed decision? But also don't skimp on effort, if you find that your
  answer is actually quite high. Do justice to what's at stake. Be a great
  decision maker.

The hackable human

- This video is the Hackable Human. And no, I'm not going to tell you how to
  hack humans, nice try. This video is about how you are a hackable human. Now,
  about 100 years ago, this would've been a mind-blowing idea because back then
  we put humans on a pedestal, and we believed that if you have a problem with
  your decision-making, it's 'cause you just haven't put enough oomph enough or
  willpower into it. People believe that you could willpower your way through
  anything. I hope that you don't still have that belief because we have, in
  the subsequent century, researched our way out of that. Now, in the many
  decades of research on behavioral economics and cognitive psychology of
  decision-making, there is a whole laundry list of what's called heuristics
  and biases, which is essentially a way of saying, "Hey, we humans do some
  silly things." "We make some systematically suboptimal, irrational
  decisions." Isn't that weird? Well, yeah. Our brain was not necessarily
  designed for the modern world that it finds itself in. So what might have
  been optimal on the savanna might not be optimal today. And also, we are
  limited in our cognitive and biological resources too. So when you haven't
  had enough sleep, your blood sugar is low, you're under strong emotions,
  under a lot of stress, don't expect optimality. And those, by the way, aren't
  the only biological factors that might affect you. Now, if you think you can
  just willpower your way through this, or maybe surely if you just know enough
  about decision-making, that somehow you'll get it optimal every time, it
  should worry you, for example, that judges have been found to give different
  sentences before and after a lunch break. So if those that we consider to be
  among the wisest in our society, who make some of the most important
  decisions there are, end up making different decisions based on how much of a
  break and how much of a snack they've had, well, that should worry you with
  respect to your own decision-making. So as a hackable human, I recommend
  taking the approach of pre-hacking yourself. That is, like an athlete who
  creates optimal conditions for their performance in a race, try to think
  through how you can get your biology to be optimal for your important
  decisions. Or at the very least, if you know that you're faced with an
  important decision, but you might be under a lot of stress or maybe you
  haven't had enough sleep, hold that thought. Prevent irrevocable allocation
  of resources if you can, and then revisit that decision when you are under
  better conditions. Now, speaking of biological things, if you're finding
  yourself struggling to stick with something, whether it's a program of study
  or a diet, an exercise regimen, something like that, you might find some
  inspiration from the cognitive science literature to be helpful here as well.
  And this time, we're going to turn to a concept in economics, which we're
  going to revisit in the group decision-making chapter, but let's introduce it
  here. And this is called the principal agent problem. It's when you have a
  business, for example, that is managed by an agent who is not the same as the
  owner or principal of that business. So the principal, the shareholders, the
  owners, they might have different incentives, like they want their business
  to grow. And the agent might have the incentive to, I don't know, maximize
  their time off or their salary or sitting on the beach or whatever it is. The
  point is, that these two entities have conflicting incentives. So what can be
  done about it? Well, if you do nothing, the agent has the opportunity to
  mismanage that business into the ground, and the principal is left worse off
  as a result. The solution is to create constraints, in other words, the
  principal creates rules that would prevent the agent from making decisions
  that would harm the principal's interests. Okay, so what has this got to do
  with sticking to some kind of program if we can't just willpower our way
  through it? So think of the principal as long-term you, and long-term you
  might really want fitness or to stick with a diet or something like that.
  Short-term you is like the agent. Short-term you might have really low blood
  sugar right now and just really wants that candy right now. So long-term you
  and short-term you might have incentives that are in conflict. So what does
  economics say the solution is? Long-term you should create constraints on
  short-term you's behavior so that short-term you is simply not able to make
  those decisions that go against your long-run interests. For example, you
  know that you haven't eaten for a while, and you're about to go for a walk,
  maybe don't take your credit card with you. Who knows, it might be easier not
  to get that candy bar in those circumstances. Now, of course, this may or may
  not work for you. The point is, simply, that your decision-making is affected
  by biological factors, a lot of those are very short-term. And so if you're
  going to make decisions differently under those circumstances, then you might
  also want to build a set of pre-hacks or constraints on your own ability to
  make suboptimal decisions. So I do recommend that you go and study a whole
  lot of that heuristics and biases literature. If you're a decision
  intelligence enthusiast, there's a lot of good stuff in there. A lot of what
  it will remind you of is that humans do some silly things, and those
  systematically silly things are worth knowing about. But if you don't go
  study all that, just know that it is worth understanding that you are not
  infinite in your capacities, and putting effort into creating the optimal
  context for your decision-making pays off in the long run.

Decisiveness

- Ah, and now we get to a trait that is decisively important for decision
  makers. So picture this scene. You're at a waterpark and there's a really
  scary slide and it's going to take you an hour to stand in line. You're going
  to climb all these stairs, you're going to get to the top of it. You get to
  the top of it. You notice how tall it is, your heart flutters and you "nope"
  out of the slide. What's wrong with that situation and why is that
  indecisive? Well, simply put, I hold nothing against you if you've got fear
  of heights, but there was a right time to make that decision. And you had all
  the information about the slide, about yourself, when you were still at the
  ground before you spent a whole hour in line. It would've been a much better
  moment to make that decision carefully, without over-investing your precious
  time and resources. And find yourself making your decision at entirely the
  wrong point in time. So why are people indecisive? Here are some reasons.
  One, it might be a simple bad habit. Not everyone realizes that there is no
  such thing as not making a decision. All there is is making the implicit
  decision to delay or postpone your decision. Or to deprioritize that
  decision. Which brings me to the second piece. People might be indecisive
  because they are distracted by other decisions and specifically by lower
  priority decisions. See, we don't have the cognitive space to put effort into
  everything all the time. So if we're spending all our time making decisions
  about what to wear today and which of three flavors of toothpaste we need to
  use right now, then we won't have that bandwidth for thinking about important
  decisions related to our careers, our families, our relationships and how we
  invest our resources and many other things. So what indecisiveness might be
  is a failure to come to terms with your priorities and to make that
  intentional space to sit down with the important decisions related to those
  priorities. Some intentionality is necessary there. Another reason that
  people might be indecisive is related to grief and emotions. That is when all
  your options are bad options, what you should do is pick the least worst one.
  When you've done your homework and you've actually evaluated your options and
  you can see that this is the least worst one, please go with it, execute on
  it. What people do instead though, is they get emotional. They feel this
  grief, they feel this upset at their best option being a pretty bad one. And
  they keep poking around in the information as if something new is going to
  magically materialize there. Well, when you've already done your homework and
  you know nothing new is going to materialize, please have the courage to
  execute, to move on. That said, you can still have your emotions and your
  grief. Just do it in parallel. And then the final one is when all your
  options are pretty similar value, like you have several great options for
  where to go on vacation. Well, if they are really similar and you know the
  difference between them is not really big enough for your effort, then maybe
  optimizing those tiny differences is just not the priority. Then allow
  yourself to, I don't know, flip a coin or something. And if you find that
  you're really, really disappointed by the outcome of that coin toss, maybe
  that tells you that the options weren't as similar as they seemed at the
  beginning, and that'll help you make your decision. But if the differences
  really are tiny, don't spend so much time worrying about getting it optimal.
  Rather save your energy for what matters more.

Objective decision-making

- We'll be talking about data soon. So now's the moment to tell you about
  something very uncomfortable called confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is a
  psychological effect where what you already believe affects how you perceive
  information. In other words, a fact isn't just a fact in black and white
  anymore when you have it printed on a page, how you see and absorb and
  process that information is not neutral, it's not objective, in any sense,
  that number is going to be read differently by you. Remembered differently.
  You're going to pay different attention to it all based on what you already
  believe before you even see that number. This should trouble you, especially
  if you ever end up in a position of decision responsibility where you're
  hiring staff to go and process data for you. Now you know that whatever
  they bring you, your brain is going to do something with that and you
  might not even realize what you're doing with that number. You might
  think something objective is going on, and subconsciously you are already
  interpreting that information in a way that simply reconfirms what you
  already believe. So what was the point of the fact finding exercise?
  Troubling, troubling indeed. Don't assume that data equals objectivity.
  Confirmation bias isn't the only way in which your brain might play
  tricks on you when it comes to processing information. Another very
  classic example comes from the behavioral economics literature where
  researchers presented exactly the same information to decision makers,
  except that they worded that information slightly differently. Did they
  get the same decisions? I mean, same facts. You should get the same
  decisions, right? The answer is no. Changing the wording of that
  information or adding some kind of irrelevant information next to it can
  change behavior entirely. That means you aren't immune to the way in
  which your mind plays tricks on you to the cognitive illusions in
  information. And that means that you shouldn't approach data as an
  exercise in pure objectivity. What you bring to it cognitively is
  important. There are ways in which you can use data to increase your
  objectivity but similarly, there are ways that you can use it to
  reconfirm what you already believe, which is the opposite of injecting
  objectivity, rather giving you bigger strength in your pre-existing
  convictions and not helping you learn anything new. And I hope that you
  will remember throughout the rest of the course and your life too, that
  the principles that you learned in this section should never be tossed
  out the window just because there are some numbers nearby. If anything,
  it should underscore the importance of the fundamentals, which should
  travel with you, no matter how complicated and technological things get.

Upgrade 1: Using data and technology

- Making decisions with nothing but pen and paper is so last century. It's time
  for some upgrades, and our first upgrade involves data. Now, don't get me
  wrong, I love data. It's so pretty. But it's decision making that's
  important. It's through our decisions, our actions, that we affect the
  world around us. Data is just a means to an end, which is incredibly
  powerful if what you're using it for is worthwhile, but it's totally
  useless otherwise. Unfortunately, there's so much hype around data these
  days that too many decision makers pronounce data like it has a capital
  D. Let's stop doing that and go back to basics to understand what's fluff
  and what's worth being excited about. Everything our senses perceive is
  data, though its storage in our cranial wet stuff does leave something to
  be desired. Quick, tell me what digits you just saw on your screen. No?
  Would it help if you'd written them down with pen and paper? Sure, but,
  ugh, that is so last century. Let's write it down electronically instead.
  When you store information in electronic form, you get better memory and
  it's easier to access it and reshape it. Books already upgrade our
  memories, and they let you access memories of people you've never met.
  But you can't go, "Abracadabra book." How many a's are in here, without
  first reading the whole thing and counting them by hand. Data on a
  computer is more powerful. You can use code to find out how many a's
  there are in all of Wikipedia. It's easy. (finger snaps) Boom, and you've
  got the answer. That's the big upgrade you get from data. Better memory.
  That's a lot to be excited about. It would blow Shakespeare's mind.
  You're basically a cyborg. But data has some limitations, too. You know
  the way you laugh at people who think, "If it's written in a book, it
  must be true." Then you turn around and say, "Numbers never lie." Come
  on. It's the same thing. And just as you've hopefully learned not to
  believe everything you read, you should also know that data might not be
  true or useful. It's simply some stuff that some human felt the need to
  record electronically. Even if it has no straight-up mistakes, it leaves
  a lot of reality out. In a later video, we'll talk about artificial
  intelligence, but I'd like to throw in a little note about AI bias while
  we're here. AI is based on the data that goes into it, and data is made
  by people. Just as an author decides what to put in a book, data doesn't
  design itself. Some human had to choose what to collect in a dataset.
  Those aren't objective decisions. Most of the issues related to AI bias
  boil down to bad choices about which data to use. If data were objective
  or magical, we'd have none of those issues, but we do. Luckily, people
  like you are building their decision skills so that we can make better
  choices as a society. Remember, there's no technology that's free of the
  implicit value of its creators, so stop looking to data for objectivity.
  The value of data is memory, not objectivity. Say yes to data, and you're
  saying yes to a revolutionary upgrade in human potential. You're here to
  learn how to turn information into better action, and with data you're no
  longer limited by how much information can fit into your own personal
  memory.

Upgrade 2: Better questions

- Where do good questions come from? I want you to imagine that you're in a
  dark, silent room. You can't feel or smell or sense anything at all. What is
  there to do here? No idea. What next? Pick at random. How would you know what
  questions are worth asking? Now imagine there's a window. You could ignore it
  and meditate to frame your decision or you could go get some inspiration by
  taking a look to see what you're dealing with. What's analytics? Taking a
  look at information. It's by being informed that you figure out what your
  options are, what assumptions are reasonable and what questions are worth
  asking in the first place. So analytics is how you get inspired to ask better
  questions. Decision makers, think of your analyst as a new sensory organ that
  you've just evolved, a new kind of eye that allows you to perceive
  information that you would otherwise have been blind to. The ability to look
  outside that window, so to speak. Not everyone has it, but it's powerful. The
  good news is you can hire someone to be your data eyes. That role is called
  analyst. That said, analytics is not decision making. As a decision maker,
  it's still your responsibility to set priorities, figure out which topics
  would be interesting, determine which questions might be worth asking and
  frame the decisions worth making. It's up to you to point your analyst at the
  window. And perhaps what's out there is inspiring. Perhaps it isn't. But
  remember that there's always a chance that there's nothing interesting to see
  out there. If you direct your new eyes at something that wasn't worth seeing,
  you wouldn't gouge them out for it, would you? Similarly, don't punish your
  analyst for finding nothing interesting in the data. Direct them to go look
  elsewhere. So what do you need to know to do analytics? Well technically,
  you're doing it right now. This is data. Digital images and sounds, just like
  this video that you're watching, are stored as arrays of numbers that look
  pretty opaque in a spreadsheet, but they come alive when you use better
  tools, like your browser, to experience them. It's all about knowing how to
  pick the right software to make sense of the information stored in electronic
  form. Just as you're doing at this very moment. I'm glad that you're watching
  this video in your browser and not in a spreadsheet. So if any person in your
  organization claims that they've never analyzed data, remind them, have you
  looked at a digital photo? Listen to music with your computer? You have
  analyzed data. So that's some great news. You, yes you, are already a data
  analyst. But that doesn't mean you're an expert analyst. An analyst's
  excellence is speed. And that's a nuanced idea. An analyst's job is to
  maximize inspiration per minute. Its speed in terms of loading the data onto
  the computer screen, speed of getting the data into the analyst's brain and
  speed of getting it into the decision maker's brain, which of course,
  involves good communication skills while wasting as little of everyone's time
  as possible, which involves the skill of dodging red herrings, which you get
  by having some domain knowledge. Managing analytics is about investing time
  into exploration. Yes, it's a decision making problem. There is no guarantee
  that you find inspiration or those great questions that you're looking for.
  So part of your expertise as a decision maker will be balancing the costs and
  benefits of exploration. But watch out. If you don't invest any effort into
  looking around, you'll be caught flatfooted when threats and opportunities
  show up. To be prepared, invest in analytics, a sensory upgrade for the
  modern decision maker.

Upgrade 3: Data-driven decisions

- Businesses are hiring data scientists in droves to make rigorous, scientific,
  unbiased data-driven decisions. And now the bad news, those decisions usually
  aren't. For a decision to be data-driven, it has to be the data as opposed to
  something else entirely that drives it, which seems like such a
  straightforward idea and yet it's so rare in practice because decision makers
  lack a key psychological habit. Imagine you're considering buying something
  online. You've boiled your decision down to whether you trust the online
  seller or not. A quick search yield some relevant data. You see that the
  seller has an average rating of 4.2 stars out of five. Well, now you can't
  use that 4.2 to drive your decision. Game over. Once you've seen the answer,
  you're free to pick the most convenient question. If the first thing you do
  is poke around in your data, then your decision will be at best something
  that I like to call data inspired. That's where we, like whales encountering
  plankton, swim around in some numbers and then we reach an emotional tipping
  point and decide. Now there were numbers near our decision somewhere. But
  those numbers didn't drive it. That decision comes from somewhere else
  entirely. Your mind was made up before the data. So the decision was there
  all along. See, it turns out that we humans interact with data selectively to
  confirm choices that we've already made in our heart of hearts. We find the
  most convenient light in which to see evidence and we don't always know we're
  doing it. You already know the name of this monster, confirmation bias. Is
  4.2 out of five a good number? Well, it depends on your bias. A decision
  maker who really wants to make that purchase is going to squint at that 4.2
  and sing a happy song about how that's a high number. It's more than 4.0.
  They'll even show a rigorous analysis about how it's statistically
  significantly higher than 4.0 with certainty. Of course it is. In the
  meantime, someone who really doesn't want to use that seller will find
  another way to frame the question in response to the data. Why would I settle
  for a seller that's less than 4.5 stars or perhaps look at those one star
  reviews? I don't like how many there are. Sound familiar? Mathematical
  complexity doesn't provide the antidote, just makes it harder to see the
  problem. And as a result, what's obvious here in this trivial example
  gets hidden in a jumble of equations. Don't assume that your friendly
  neighborhood data scientist sees it either. The more ways there are to
  slice the data, the more your analysis is a breeding ground for
  confirmation bias. And as a result, decision makers simply end up using
  data to feel better about what they were going to do anyway. When an
  analysis is complex or the data are hard to process, a pinch of tragedy
  finds its way into our comedy. Sometimes boiling everything down to
  arrive at that 4.2 number takes months of toil by a hoard of data
  scientists and engineers. And at the end of a grueling journey that team
  triumphantly triumphantly presents the result. It's 4.2 out of five. The
  math was done meticulously. The team worked nights and weekends to get it
  in on time. And what does the decision maker do? Yep, same as our
  previous 4.2. Look at it through their confirmation bias goggles with no
  effect on real world actions. Doesn't even matter whether it's accurate.
  Nothing would be different if all those poor data scientists just made
  some numbers up. When decision makers lack fundamental skills, there is
  no mathematics in the world that can fix it. Your data professionals will
  not contribute to data-driven decision making. Using data like that to
  feel better about actions that you're going to take anyway is an
  expensive and wasteful hobby. And data scientist friends, if your
  organization suffers from this kind of decision maker, I'd suggest
  sticking to the most lightweight and simple analysis to save your time
  and money. Until decision makers are better trained, all that showy
  mathematical jiu jitsu is producing nothing but dissipated heat. Oh, and
  remember this important principle. If you try to use the same data point
  to come up with your question and also your answer, you're doing it
  wrong. That's exactly the gotcha this video is warning you against. If
  you want to use data to ask good questions and also get good answers to
  them, to use data for both inspiration and rigor, which we'll talk about
  in the next video, you need to split your dataset into two separate
  pieces and never mix them up.

Upgrade 4: Better answers

- In the last video you learned that your decision isn't data-driven if you set
  criteria after you looked at your data. To get rigorous answers to data
  questions it's important to deal with information in the right order. So
  let's upgrade that upgrade. Here's how to frame a data-driven decision. Begin
  by asking yourself what you do under no new information. That's right, you
  heard me. If you learn nothing else, you look at no other data, what are you
  going to physically do? Answering this takes strength of character. You can't
  punt it to data. You really have to think about the decision problem and
  answer truthfully. What am I going to pick right now if I have to make the
  decision this instant? What we're doing here is selecting the default action,
  a core concept in decision intelligence. But wait, what if you truly have no
  default action? No starting preference, no preferred option. Well, pure
  agnosticism is kind of rare in the human animal. We like to pretend that we
  don't have a preference but often we're actually lying to ourselves. But
  look, if you truly, truly, truly don't have a preference and you're
  indifferent, then you certainly won't need any kind of complicated
  statistical approach. Simply stick with analytics and go with your best
  guess. The thing about statistical thinking is that what you're really asking
  yourself is does the information change my mind? So if your mind isn't set to
  anything there's no need for all that complicated stuff. Okay, so that's step
  one, no information. Next is full information. This requires incredible
  mental flexibility because you are going to have to do your best to imagine,
  wait for it, all possible states of the universe. Yeah. Imagine that you
  could have literally any information you want, and then describe the
  universes in which you want to take your default action versus not want to
  take it. In other words, what would it take to convince you? Now, if you
  happen to have all the information actually available to you, guess what kind
  of analysis you're going to do next? Look at the information, see what the
  number is, and ta-da. You're either on this side of the line or you're on
  that side of the line. Nothing complicated to do, you're finished. So where
  might you need to go to the next step which is dealing with partial
  information? Ah-huh, when you don't actually have the facts you need. See if
  you can work with facts, you don't need statistics. Full information is
  always better than partial information. Statistics is kind of an act of
  desperation really. You need it when you don't have the full facts available.
  That means you're dealing with uncertainty and you'll be forced to take a
  statistical approach. Like imagine if what you care about is data about the
  whole ocean but the information you actually have access to is unfortunately
  just this little bit of ocean water. This is not everything that you need for
  your decision. This is a poultry piece of partial information. And so going
  to have uncertainty as to the true value of the metric that you care about.
  Realizing that you're dealing with partial information and uncertainty is
  your cue to approach your friendly neighborhood statistician because you've
  already framed your decision carefully up to here and now it's very easy for
  the statistician to pick it up from there and help you. Whereas if you try to
  come to them at the very beginning you're asking them to do your job. If
  they're better at it than you are, well, that doesn't bode well for your
  career as a decision maker. If they're not, you're making a huge mistake
  delegating it to them. What a statistician does for you here isn't magic.
  They're helping you balance the probability of making the wrong decision with
  the budget that you're willing to pay for your data. Subject to your risk
  preferences and budget, they help you take the decision in a manner that
  delivers on those preferences. So that's the upgrade in this video.
  Statistics gives you more rigor and better answers under uncertainty. So to
  recap what we've learned about framing decisions, deal with information in
  this order. Know information first, which gives you your default action. Then
  go to thinking about full information. If you knew everything about all
  possible universes, in which ones would you want to take your action versus
  not? Then ask yourself, do you actually have that full information to answer
  your question with certainty? And if you do, just go ahead and answer it. If
  you don't, you're dealing with partial information and you're going to need a
  statistician to help you out. Remember, don't waste your time rigorously
  answering the wrong question. That's on you as a decision maker to think
  about which decisions are worth making and to ask those questions carefully.
  Then apply statistics to get better answers but only where needed.

Upgrade 5: Decision automation

- As we saw in the previous video, when there's certainty, we can just look up
  our answers from the data directly. Data science is more interesting under
  uncertainty. So what is data science? Data science is the discipline of
  making data useful. So let's look at a map of data science. It's an umbrella
  term, with four components involving the number of decisions that we know we
  want to make before we begin. So ask yourself, how many decisions do I want
  to make in this situation? And if the answer is, no idea, I don't know of any
  decisions yet, that means you're open-minded and you're exploring. That
  branch of data science is called analytics. If the answer is that you have a
  few important decisions, that's statistics. If the answer is many, many, many
  decisions, that's machine learning and AI, terms which these days, it's okay
  for you to use somewhat interchangeably. If the answer is, (speaker clears
  her throat), negative one decisions, in other words, where you already
  know the answer and you want to use data for persuading other people,
  well, that's another kind of dark art entirely. That's not decision
  making. Data storytelling, data journalism, marketing is what you'd call
  this. And though you use data for it, it is not part of the decision
  disciplines. Now, let's go back to the situation where your answer was
  many decisions, especially if it's at a huge scale, like millions of
  decisions or billions of decisions. Well, statistics is definitely not
  going to cut it in that situation. You're going to need machine
  learning/AI. So this is decision automation. And I've got a whole
  separate course about this, which you can find on YouTube, that's called
  Making Friends With Machine Learning. But in a nutshell, the point of
  machine learning and AI is to use patterns in data to create a model
  that'll execute decisions automatically when you put new data points in.
  Machine learning and AI really just boils down to two lines, optimize
  this objective on those examples, go. When we say optimize this
  objective, that's about saying what success looks like, what it means to
  get a good score. And which examples you want to use, well, that's which
  data the computer should learn from. Now, look at these two points. They
  sound very decisiony, don't they? Each of them is the responsibility of
  the decision maker. What should success look like? That depends on your
  priorities, what you're trying to achieve. And which examples are the
  right ones to learn from? Well, again, that is up to you as the decision
  maker. And this requires exactly the kind of expertise that you're
  learning in this course. Most of the problems that we see with AI systems
  find their origin in failures of the project leader's decision making,
  not in bugs in technology. So if you're going to be using an AI system
  for automating your important business processes, how do you know if you
  can trust it? Should you trust it? No, never trust anything you
  haven't tested, whether it's a human or a machine. So how does that
  trust thing work? Well, that is statistics again. That is one
  important decision you know you want to make before the data. And
  getting back to what we've learned already, where do you start? With
  a default action, I hope your default is don't launch it. Then,
  what's your available information? How it performs on test data,
  which from earlier videos you know should never be part of the data
  that you use to train the system, because we don't use the same data
  point for inspiration and rigor, both. That's confirmation bias on a
  massive scale. Then what about that metric and objective? That's up
  to you as decision maker, the criteria also. You perform the test,
  that's a statistical calculation, which tells you whether to launch
  or not launch the machine learning system. So all of this boils down
  to the decision basics that you've been learning all along. Now, it
  is very important to be able to clearly state what it means to
  succeed at the decision automation task. So all those skills you've
  developed for being a wise decision maker and framing your metrics,
  thinking about how to decide, all those things come into play here in
  machine learning and AI. Decision skills are more important than ever
  before, so I'm so glad that you've taken this course.

Group Decisions

- The big lesson of this video is that you might not be the only person in
  charge. You might not be in charge at all. You need to practice the skill of
  diagnosing who the true decision makers are and how decision responsibility
  is shared among them. Without the skill, it'll be very hard to navigate
  organizational decision making. In the previous section, we grew your skills
  beyond pen and paper decision making towards leveraging technology and train
  specialists to expand your ability to make better decisions. But is it really
  you who's in charge of the decision? In many situations, it's more
  complicated than that. Let's talk about group decision making. There are some
  big benefits to making decisions as a group. You might think you know best,
  but if you're serious about good decision making, it's worth protecting
  yourself against your own blind spots by adding diverse perspectives to cover
  more ground. Having multiple independent decision makers can balance out a
  single individual's extreme tendencies and also provide coverage for those
  foibles of biology, like physical tiredness. Making decisions in a group
  might dampen flashes of individual brilliance, but also places guardrails
  against highly unwise decisions. It also balances out individual incentives
  with the net result being more aligned to the organization's vision.
  Individual incentives. Do you remember the principle agent problem from our
  earlier section? The principle agent problem comes about when the principles,
  the owners of the business, have different incentives from the agents, the
  people who are hired to manage it. Having a single agent with a unique hidden
  incentive can cause all kinds of problems for an organization. Having
  multiple independent decision makers, agents, can balance out that
  individual's incentives with the net result being more aligned to what the
  organization needs, and hopefully what the principal intended. Not always
  though. Do bear in mind. Bear in mind, that the most foolproof solution to
  the principal agent problem is to create constraints that prevent the agents
  from abusing the power they've been afforded. Those are some benefits of
  group decision making. It's not all roses, though. There are some major
  downsides to group decision making too. The first is that the difficulty goes
  way up. Good group decision making requires each member to have a higher
  level of decision skill. To clarify, I'm talking about multiple people
  embarking together on that end-to-end journey of judgment, deciding how to
  decide and decision making. That's very different from one person making a
  decision and then calling a group meeting to sell it to their organization.
  True collaboration on the decision process takes more skill than individual
  decision making, so buckle up. The group element also tends to increase the
  time it takes to make a decision. But that's not all. Many of the benefits of
  making decisions in a group such as balancing out an individual's myopia or
  extreme tendencies require independence between the decision makers.
  Unfortunately, if you shove everyone in a room together, you'll lose the
  benefit of independence and you'll start to see an unbalanced influence of
  extraneous factors like charisma, confidence, overconfidence, and status. You
  may find that the loudest voice, rather than the wisest voice, is the one
  with outsized influence on the decision. Sometimes the whole thing devolves
  into a social exercise rather than a decision-making exercise. Allowing
  information to drive your decision takes a level of humility that's sometimes
  easier to achieve in private than in a group. It can be really tempting to
  get too caught up in appearing to have been right all along to let your mind
  be changed by information. Luckily, now that you're aware of all that, you
  can start designing the rules of engagement to nurture independent
  perspectives before you put everyone together. Oh, and do note that the note
  taker in a group setting has outsized influence too. Also, watch out for
  phenomena like diffusion of responsibility when you have a lot of people.
  When responsibilities are not clearly assigned, people may implicitly assume
  that their effort's not needed so they might sit back and relax, making their
  participation a waste of the organization's time rather than an opportunity
  for their perspective to be taken into account. The takeaway here is that the
  more people share in the decision, the higher everyone's skills need to
  be in order for group decision making to tap into the benefits and
  mitigate the downsides. Always keep in mind the importance of
  constructing opportunities for independence in the process. One powerful
  way to do that is to limit the number of people with actionable decision
  responsibility and increase the number of advisors. Making a decision
  that is turning information into a selection of actions is very different
  from advocating for the execution of a decision you've already made. So
  as a leader, you shouldn't have any illusions about whether the
  decision's being made in a group setting or the group is convened to
  ratify an already made decision. Another issue that makes things even
  harder is when decision responsibility is shared unequally by the
  decision makers. This takes even more skill to navigate. You'll need to
  learn to read between the lines to diagnose that situation. Since
  decision responsibility and its level is often uncomfortably tangled up
  with power and organizational politics. The big lesson of this video is
  that you might not be the sole person in charge. You might not be in
  charge at all. You need to practice the skill of diagnosing who the true
  decision makers are and how decision responsibility is shared among them.
  Without the skill, it'll be very hard to navigate organizational decision
  making.

The career-making question

- As we saw in the previous video, you might not be the one in charge of the
  decision. Once you've identified the person or people in charge, how do you
  make yourself useful as a decision expert? By asking them the most powerful
  question, the one that'll make your career. Here it comes, the career-making
  question. Drum roll please. (drum beats rumble) (cymbal clangs) What would it
  take to change your mind? Let's unpack why this is such a powerful question.
  It kicks off a whole conversation that'll reveal very useful things. For
  example, you're likely to glean some good clues about whether the person
  you're talking to is actually responsible for the decision, which helps with
  the problem in our previous video. But there's so much more here. Before you
  try to help a decision-maker, you need to know whether there's actually a
  decision to be made in the first place. If there's no information that can
  change someone's mind, then there is no decision on the table. It has already
  been made, and any attempts at data will be for persuasion, not
  decision-making. Sometimes leaders may appear indecisive on purpose, for good
  strategic reasons. Sometimes they've made a decision, but they don't want you
  to know. It might be a matter of politics, trust, or something as simple as
  their belief that a true answer will demotivate you. The ugliest combination
  of all three is when an organization has hired data scientists too early and
  their leader is trying to hide it from them by giving them technical busywork
  to pass the same. Another reason a leader might look indecisive is when
  they're planning on getting more information later, perhaps from a source
  they're not willing to tell you about, so they're delaying their
  decision-making until they've got the data they need. They might also be
  delaying until another quarter or they've hired someone else or they've
  gotten more budget. Learning to read between the lines is a very useful skill
  in business, and the career-making question can help there too. What else
  will you learn when you ask, "What will it take to change your mind?" It
  unpacks right into the framework for decision-making that we learned a few
  videos ago. First, if their mind is set, what is it set to? That tells you
  the decision-maker's default action. Can be a lot easier to extract their
  default action from them than to shout, "Hey, what's your default action?"
  Number two, what would it take to change your mind? Well, a clear answer here
  tells you the decision metric and criteria, but clarity takes expertise. And
  it's one thing to ask a decision expert. It's another thing to ask a leader
  without much decision training. So if you're tasked with providing decision
  support, you'll need to translate between what's going on in a leader's head
  and a clear statement that a data science team can work with. The
  career-making question is a wonderful way to get that conversation started.
  Asking this question is the most useful habit I've ever developed. It's great
  for my personal life, for my career, and for getting my own thoughts in
  order. So repeat after me. What would it take to change your mind? Now,
  as you're having this conversation, you might like to ask a few
  follow-ups, like how scared are you? This gets at the value of
  clairvoyance. How important is this decision? How badly could it go if we
  just tossed a coin? This tells you a little bit about the relative
  difference between options, which can help with real indecisiveness. But
  where it's always worth starting is the career-making question itself.
  What would it take to change your mind?

Building a data-driven culture

- How do you champion a culture of turning information into better action, a
  culture of decision intelligence? You're going to need two pedals: an
  accelerator and a brake. Let's start with the brake. If you're hiring a bunch
  of data professionals to keep up with the Joneses, it probably means that
  your organization doesn't really know what it wants them for, and you're in
  danger of failing the test that we talked about in the value of clairvoyance
  video. See, here's the thing about professional data scientists. These are
  folks who've been answering every homework question about data. That doesn't
  exactly train them to put their pens down when the data question isn't
  particularly valuable. Learning to prioritize your effort takes experience.
  So if you've just hired a bunch of junior people, you might need to put the
  brakes on their exuberance, otherwise, what they'll end up doing is treating
  data as if it's infinitely valuable and doing a lot of very complicated yet
  very useless things. That is not good decision making. That's not decision
  intelligence. You'll also need to tap the brakes on data charlatans in your
  organization. These are the folks who pretend to be data-driven when they're
  actually using data and complicated-sounding models, equations, arguments to
  bamboozle you into accepting their side of the story. Here's the thing. If
  you trust someone to make decisions on your behalf, you don't need their
  data. They need their data, and they're going to make the decision, but you
  don't need their data. If you don't trust them, their data doesn't make
  things any better. As W. Edwards Deming famously said, "Without data, you're
  just a person with an opinion." Well, unfortunately, with data, you're still
  just a person with an opinion. As we saw in earlier videos of this course,
  there's a lot of subjectivity in decision making, and as if that's not bad
  enough, confirmation bias means that two people can interpret the same
  information differently and end up with two different opinions. So how do you
  spot a data charlatan? It's simple. Did they pre-register their decision
  criteria before they access the data? If not, you can't trust that their data
  drove their decision. Don't let data charlatans prey on the data unsavvy. See
  that sleight of hand for what it is. If there is no decision process
  documentation, tap the brakes on all that mathy ju-jitsu and figure out if
  you want to delegate decision responsibility to them in a way that frees them
  from the need to persuade you with the fancy footwork, or if you'd prefer to
  take over that decision making, and then you deal with the data, with turning
  information into better action. Now, how about the accelerator? Sometimes an
  organization is scared of data and scared of technology, so you might need to
  sell data-driven decision making a little bit. Good decision making is the
  most important skill there is, the steering wheel for your life and your
  organization. So why wouldn't you want the ability to turn information into
  better action? Knowledge is power, after all. Perhaps the issue is that your
  leaders are intimidated by things they don't understand. That's okay. Remind
  them that they don't need to be the data expert in order to get value out of
  data science. What they need is to understand enough about data science to
  collaborate effectively with experts, or they need an expert like you to
  serve as translator between their vision and the specialists that can help
  them achieve it. But it's not enough for leaders to be on board. Data science
  doesn't make sense without data, and the garbage in, garbage out principle
  applies. Good data is an investment that an organization has to make
  intentionally. You'll need to advocate not only for the budget to collect and
  procure the data, you'll also need to hire the required personnel and perhaps
  build the infrastructure required to move that data around. And that itself
  is an important investment decision that you now have the skills to think
  about in a smart way. The key takeaway is that a data-driven organization
  embraces the value of good data-driven decision making. And that's not just
  about the data. That's also about the decision technique. So tap the brakes
  whenever data is misused and unactionable, and tap the accelerator pedal if
  you encounter resistance to technology. Then, if you see opportunities to
  make great investments in your organization's ability to make decisions with
  data, that itself is going to be a decision that you'll need to make, perhaps
  with data.

Barriers to organizational decision-making

- Before we talk about delivering value in a large organization, let's come
  face to face with some barriers to good organizational decision making.
  First, there could be information illiteracy and data illiteracy, which makes
  it hard to communicate. Two, a lack of skills doesn't help matters. Sometimes
  experts are hard to hire. And there might be a lack of advocacy about what's
  possible. Then, decision responsibility might be spread unwisely in an
  organization. As you become more and more senior, a lot of your duties will
  boil down to making sure that decision responsibility is correctly delegated.
  And please, I hope you haven't gotten all the way to this point in the
  course, and you still think that the person at the top has the bandwidth to
  make every decision in their organization. Absolutely not. Delegation is
  important. Then number five, there might be a lagging investment in
  personnel, processes, data, and infrastructure needed for data-driven
  decision making. And then there are those things around humans being human.
  Let's be realistic. Having a large organization means lots of people, which
  is great, since you get more hands on deck and more diverse perspectives.
  Unfortunately, having lots of people also means you'll be dealing with
  misaligned incentives, people doing things in all kinds of different
  directions, maybe in silos where they're not communicating well, and there'll
  be a whole mess of power and status, which can get in the way of steering a
  good course for the organization as a whole. There are all kinds of reasons
  why someone might be in a position of power, and these may or may not have
  anything to do with their decision skills. Now, I am not advocating for
  firing leaders who are unskilled decision makers. Instead, I would love a
  world where we recognize that decision making is a skill, and a world in
  which we learn to ask, who's on that team? Is this leader well supported by a
  decision professional? And it doesn't have to be one per leader. You could
  have one decision professional serving multiple leaders in an organization.
  And it doesn't even have to be a decision professional as such. Just someone
  on the team who has solid decision skills. Quite often, the problem with
  decision makers is simply that they lack the skills, not that they lack the
  will to do the right thing. So a quick lesson for you is to get in the habit
  of asking whether decision skills are well represented on a team. If not,
  that's an opportunity for you to either lend a hand, or if that's not an
  option, flee. On that note, if you internalized the most important video in
  this course, the one about outcome bias, you'll know that a prerequisite of
  decision excellence is having good documentation of your decision process. To
  diagnose a team's decision skills, you'll need to look into that
  documentation. And if there isn't any, that's a problem. Do bear in mind,
  though, that it can be hard to judge from the outside. That documentation
  might exist, but not in a form anyone's willing to tell you about.

Delivering value in a large organization

- Now that you've built your skills in this course, how do you deliver value in
  a large organization? First, identify the decision-makers at a higher level
  than you. Then understand their priorities, and if there is no one at a
  higher level than you, you will be setting those priorities. Number three, to
  serve your senior decision-makers better, understand their information
  sources, and that's not just the electronic data. Information as a whole. Who
  are they having their conversations with? Whatever their information sources,
  can you supplement them? Can you find better information? And can you perform
  an analysis of the existing information in a way that inspires those
  decision-makers to ask valuable and relevant questions? Number four,
  understand what it would take to change your decision-maker's mind. Can you
  perform the evaluation and see if their mind is ready to change? Is there a
  decision to be made and can you help with it? Number five, look around in
  your organization and see which decisions are being made repeatedly. Which of
  these can be executed? If there are a lot of them and they lend themselves to
  data-driven automation, consider machine learning and AI. Number six, work
  with decision-makers to properly understand their needs and the
  organization's needs. See how you can help them that might be a little bit
  outside the box. Number seven, evaluate data sources and what's going on with
  your organization's data engineering and infrastructure. The availability of
  data doesn't mean you can make it useful, and similarly, just because you
  have personnel or infrastructure doesn't mean that you'll be able to do good
  data-driven decision-making. You need everything together, especially at
  scale. So think a lot about what budgets you have and the availability of
  resources. Understand your organization's data curation needs and look into
  who's responsible for what. Get insight into when the whole system will be
  ready to use, because if you've been hired to do some kind of complicated
  decision intelligence work and there simply aren't those components, that
  investment hasn't been made, then you will need to reevaluate how to be
  useful to your organization. Then number eight, as you're growing in
  seniority, you'll be hiring people, and when these people are data experts,
  it'll be up to you to protect their careers. Understand that data science
  tends to have a leadership skills shortage, so this will not necessarily be
  easy work. Your data scientists have to be aligned to the important decisions
  or the important automation challenges in order to have the impact that
  guarantees them a smooth career path. Number nine, always take the principle
  agent problem into account. Think about incentives, and think about how best
  to help group decision-making be effective. Then number 10, now it gets
  obvious. Perform good work and advocate for it. And finally, remember that
  the solution to most challenges, even to technical challenges, boils down to
  people. With solid collaboration skills and strong decision fundamentals,
  you'll be well equipped to tackle whatever life throws your way.

Are you a good decision-maker?

- Are you a good decision maker? Well, now that we've reached the end of the
  course we are ready to answer that question so you can give yourself a yes if
  you understand all of the following, especially the first one. Do you
  understand the difference between an outcome and a decision and how to
  mitigate outcome bias? If you've answered no to that, I highly recommend
  going back and rewatching the video on outcome bias since that is the most
  important lesson in the course. Once you've covered that, let's look at some
  of the others. Do you understand confirmation bias and how to mitigate it? Do
  you remember the factors that make a decision easy versus hard? And have you
  internalized them enough to ping a little alert to yourself when you find
  yourself dealing with a hard decision so you can slow down or maybe even seek
  help or a second opinion? Do you remember the trick about the value of
  clairvoyance and how to avoid overspending on a decision? What about decision
  framing? Do you remember the no information, full information partial
  information progression, and the importance of having clarity on your default
  action? Can you state what makes a decision data driven and the pros and cons
  of using data to make your decision? It's not always pros, despite what some
  of those data professionals will tell you. Have you learned how to identify
  the decision maker in a group setting? Do you remember what the career making
  question in data and decision science is? And do you understand the
  importance of investing carefully in tools and data as well as the way to
  nurture your experts and build a data-driven organization? If you answered
  yes to all of these you're well on your way to being a good decision maker.
  If you answered, maybe, not sure or even no to some of these, don't worry.
  There's plenty of opportunity for you to go out there and learn more.
  Naturally, no one becomes an expert decision maker in just one decision
  intelligence course, but I hope that this is the start of a lifelong practice
  for you in building your decision skills. And if you're interested in
  learning more from me I do have a YouTube channel and an active blog
  where I frequently talk about data and decision making, so do check those
  out if you're interested.
