## Focus and Procrastination

[You're not Lazy: How to End Procrastination For Life - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qriNOmeSrmI)

Don't call it only procrastination - specifiy the behaviour. It is a whole
category of behaviour ( Social media scrolling, Watching tv, eating sweets,
snoozing alarms ) that leads to undesirable outcome. The day we deal with each
one is different.

1. By being specific abotu the behaviour we can be specific with the intervention.
   - Think about the  Environment and the triggers as well.
   - Behaviours are a sympton of something else
   - make the desirable behaviour ridiculously easy to do, and the undesirable
     behaviour thake a ridiculous amount of effort to do

2. Focus on the driver of the behaviour

Example: Trying to study , but end up binge watching:
( Triggers are the things that activate habits )

| Intentions | Events Before             | Events During                       | Events Result                     | Feelings                             | Triggers                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Study      | Eating dinner, planned to | Thought about going downstairs and  | Ended up turning the tv on and    | Inittially motived and focused,      | comfortable couch, netflow logo |
|            | study afterwards          | open book, but decided to spent 20m | watching a show netflix suggested | but overwhelmed about where to start | and new series recommendation   |
|            |                           | digesting in the couch after dining |                                   |                                      |                                 |

Changes:

- Log out of  Netflix
- Move the couch
- Don't plan on studying after dinner
- Get my books out in advance
- Have a clear study plan in place
- Keep your shoes on to prevent layin on couch
- Use transition ritual like boiling the kettle for tea or coffer
- Use background noise to get started
- go to the library

VERY SPECIFIC

- If we were sleepy or tired -> change sleep schedule, change time of day spent studying
- If social media was distractive -> app blockers

First step is always identify the behaviour.
Think of yourself as an evil behaviour architect, indirectly manipulating then
to do this  exact behaviour

3. In case it doesn't work, it is possible that you're addicted: Slow your brain down.
   Your brain has becomed addicted to short dopamine hits

- Remove distractions
- Start mindfulness meditation
- Your brain should slow down overtime
- This is the hardest part.

   activities ( ritual / routine ) delives the focus right away

   talk with people about that thing.

[The Trick to Permanent Motivation (Productivity Coach) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boo5gtr6oRU\&t=7s)

Students see motivation as inherent, fixed attribute they see motivation as a
driving influence/force that power every single behaviour The problem with this
overall mindset is that "you use motivation on simple day things", which burns
it up. So you're always looking to add up motivation and add more fuel, which
is not sustainable.

How do we create systems of working and productivity which are not dependent on
motivation.

> "What if we have uninteresing topics?"

2 types of motivation

1. External
   - Videos,
   - teachers,
   - poster
2. Internal
   - Derived inherently from within ourself. Such as a sense of identity. People
     don't usually see themselves as a learner
   - The task. e.g. Gaming .
     What part of this are we not finding motivating?
   - inherent interest on the subject
   - process interest
   > Stop looking at the destination, and look at the path
   > \-> Most people like getting knowledgeable at subjects, but they conduct learning in a way that is boring

Motivation is not the issue, it is the problem.
The solution is not to force yourself to do something that sucks, but make it
not suck in the first place.

We should try to derive more from the internal sources

> "Try to find out the *specific* reason why you're de-motivated. For most

> itself. "
