Hey @skoret
I'm working around the /bank-transfer/{quote|available-types} endpoint, and
noticed you've done some work there recently.

My task is to display one of Brazil's taxes separately in the fees breakdown.

I was under the impression that a `core-pricing` call was done during this
quote endpoint as to fetch the transfer fees.

However, I've noticed that it seems that the transfer fees are actually sent
from the mobile, via the `transferFees` params, and just returned as is ( after
a possible fx change ).

Do you have an understanding on why this is?

Also, as I see, there is no mechanism to generically extend this endpoint,
other than add hardcoded fields. Is that so or am I missing something?
