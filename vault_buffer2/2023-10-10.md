> Take, for example, a requirement that every entry point to your web app (i.e. a page or HTTP API), apart from a few exceptions like login and reset password, should require authentication.
> The “test harder” religion interprets this as:
> For every entry point
> Write a test that
> Ensures non-authenticated requests return 403
> That's a lot of tests, and even worse is that you have to remember to write them.
> “Test smarter” says:
> Write a test that
> For every entry point
> Ensures non-authenticated requests return 403
> That's one test. “Write a test” is executed in developer time, so in the first example the loop ("For every entry point") is also executed in developer time. Push the loop inside the test, and it gets executed in computer time instead.
