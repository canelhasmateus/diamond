Conceptual Framework

You want to synthesize things such they're not new information; e.g. ( acute
abdomen, apendicitis , bow obstruction), you want to think about these in the
same way.

1. Can create analogies
2. categorize and group information - aren't always  good; The creation of
   groups do not mean the contents are logically bound together ; you should
   try to group by "why"

The notes are a reflection of the learning.

Grouped:
When we have ideas, we hshould be aiming into organizing it into
categoriese and buckets

> Chunking

Reflective
Whatever your notes are, this should be an reflection of what is
going on your mind. Linear writing isn't how we normally  learn;

Interconnected
We're grouping these ideas and categories  , and connecting them
between each other; More connections that go outside of the "obvious" ones

Non-verbal
We're always using verbal methods to learn; Using various modes of
stimulation increases learning, retention, motivation, creativity

Directional
Arranging these connections in such a way that there is a
directionality , an ordering. This fives us flow, that is, cause and effect
relationships ( logical framework )

Emphasized
Make the main point more distinctive
