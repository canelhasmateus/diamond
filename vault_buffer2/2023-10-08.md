How can teachers help with making note-taking easier?
Most uni teachers don't have educational experience, they're not necessarily
invested in being a better educator

In schools, its different, but they're usually over-worked

unless 1:1, it is not realistic , they're not gonna deliver information that is
perfect for you.

`Learner self-regulation`: ability to override all kinds of external variables.

Teachers and educators should spent less time on optimising delivery, but more
time helping students navigate difficulties and their curiosity.

Don't:
"What relationship are you thinking of" -> How you're trying to think about that relationship
"Did you group it in this way?" -> How are you trying to group it?
"Did you think about it the right way?" -> What thought processes are you engaging to navigate this information
