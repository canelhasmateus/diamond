[5 Techniques of Every Successful Student - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJKNtXgo39o\&t=1s)

1. Deeper Learning
2. Active Learning
3. Threshold concepts:
   core concepts in a subject whe4re understanding these sujects is key to
   transforming the way a student understand the whole subject

allows to access an entirely new way of looking at things;

learning is recursively;

- You don't learn perfectly the first time.
- go back to learn it again and again, ; certain things make more sense when
  you've learning already , some details that did not make sense now do;

Excursive Approah

- being in a journey with an outcome that has allowances for diversions.

Active Learning is a way to tap into tthese threshold concepts, and includes,
but is not limited to class polls, quizzes group discussions, game based
learning

Techniques and examples

1. Include Priming ( Pre-study )
2. Event
   Drowsy, sleepy,  -> It takes effort to be engaged with the information
   Ask questions ( even if only inside head ); why and how questions are
   usually better to relate it back to the big picture
3. Revision
   The more you wait the more you're going to forget; this first window  is
   very important, revising it in the same day gives disproportionately higher
   benefit than doing it in two days.
   Ideally before going to sleep, to take advantage of `sleep dependent memory
    consolidation`.
4. Good revision techniques accentuate the `relationship` of these details
   back to the big picture. ->> Mind Map
   Using multimodal channels can be better. Using too much words reduce
   `cognitive load`; ->> Delayed note-taking
5. Last minute revisions - Use `recall`, not recognition based learning.
   Try to learn things different every time.
   e.g. Teaching

[What is Priming? Increase Learning by 40% | Study Clinic - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZWP-eA-lCg\&t=1s)

Priming is giving yourself an understanding of what you're about to learn; the
skeleton;

" Very frequently, when studying, People try to construct this human from the
skin inwards "

> Draw the rest of the fucking owl
>
> > Inquiry-based learning

[Why 90% of Students Never IMPROVE | Study Clinic - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvAhtiZcpTU)

The low-risk approach is that you slowly remove the `external dependency` of learning

1. Rely on the `act of` notetaking, studying, reading. ( learning as a byproduct of the process )
   This means that you see things in a closed process.
   "The act of highlightining makes it easier to go back to it later"
2. Internal focus
   "From a learning point of view, does highlighting help me `learn it`?

Different levels of learning and understanding, and various frameworks

- Solo Taxonomy ( Basic Recognition .... Apply that in abstract contexts )

Memorization is a different type of learning compared to logical understanding.

- It is a form of learning that allows to anchor and force relevance

The mindmap is not a single technique.
`Human cognitive architecture`

> " As Justin says, there are multiple ways to categorise any set of concepts.
> So how do you choose between them? My strong suggestion is to structure each
> map as an answer to a question - an explicit question that you write on the

1. Grouping of information

- It makes sense to group it in multiple possible ways

Fundamnetal principles of learning

- cognitive load theory
- Intrinsic / Extraneous Load
- Generic Cognitive skills
- Generation Effect
- Hypercorrection Effect
- NoteTaking
- Storage of information
- Encoding
- Deep processing
- Retrieval
- Spacing
- Expanding gap expancing intervals
- Interleaving
- Massed Practice
- Flashcards
- Cue-utilization framework
- Effort as cue reponse
- Active vs passive learning
- Priming
- Knowledge Schemas
- Inquiry-based learning
- Time and Energy management
- Prioritisation Frameworks
- Motivation
- Seligman's positive psychology
- Kolb's Experiential learning cycle

1. Make your mind map is an accurate reflection of your thought process.
2. Do no avoid the thinking process of cleaning up the information and organising it.

[The 2 MUST-HAVE Ingredients to Study Efficiently - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWrxagzHSSY)

"Efficient Student"

- Covers what is needed in a short amount of time

Efficiency follows this pattern

Encoding and retrieval

- Buckets with holes can be patched with encoding
- Information will always be forgotten in some form. One of these common forms
  is because of `Retrieval Failure`: Information that was encoeeded but is
  forgotten because of a lack of retrieval.
  How well it was encoded affects how much time is necessary until this failure
  mode: As encoding gets better, we need *less* retrieval ( not none )

[Studying My Masters in 1/6th of the Time - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmVsYQ4WSHc)

"Rate limiting step"
\-> e.g. Relying only with active recall and spaced repetition

1. How will I retrieve this information? therefore, how do i want to organize this?

- Mental Schema
  \-> need to create super and sub chunks.
  \-> Why is this important , and how do these piece of information relate to each other?
- Confusion is a sign of higher intrinsic cognitive load, which promotes higher quality encoding

> order control, syntopical reading

___

`heuristic memory processing`

- frequently used
- recently used
- needed to make decisions

[What I Learned after 5000 Hours of Studying - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2Ogza-n3i0)

1. You can overdose on learning techniques
   > A `therapeutic index` is the range in which something is good for you. e.g.
   > too little and a drug has no effect, too much and it can harm you.
   > Be careful about exploiting too early , and lose sight of exploring.
2. Don't create learning debt
   The methods used in the present may create problems for your future self.
   Re-learn things properly in a way that it is useful
   - Identify your retrieval needs ( what do you need to know, how do you need to know and think about it, how long )
   - Map current learning process ( what do you do when information comes in? )
   - Challenge your reasoning ( why do use the methods and process that you use?
     do these allow you to achieve the needs you have ? )
   - Learn and experiment
   > "You have the knowledge, but you aren't being able to apply it to real patients"
3. No pain no gain - `desirable difficulty`
   To build expertise:
   - Know things about the subject
   - Know how to use what you know to make sense of new information

> Jigsaw puzzle is a pretty good model of knowledge aggregation.

Studying only leads to learning when

1. The information is encoded in your memory
2. You can Use that knowledge through retrieval

`Transfer-Appropriate processing`

- How you should initially encode information depends on how you're going to
  use it in the future.  "In a recall test, with pair of associated words, we
  can try different approaches:
  1. Focus on the relationship between cue and target
  2. Focus on the relationship between targets, creating groups When doing
     the first one, free recall becomes harder. Cued recall becomes harders when
     practicing the second one. "
- This is why realistic, applied practice early on the learning process can
  improve learning. Knowing what you're going to do with the information helps
  in choosing an appropriate encoding strategy

Students often confuse `recognition` for `recollection`

- This is what usually happens when doing highlighting

[You're Not Forgetful: My System for Memorising Everything - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxURe-EUmAs)

"For the longest time we used to think that forgetting was a passive process;
that the things we failed to memorized fully and if it failed, we were left
iwth the default, which was forggeing .
Forgetting is it own active process, with its own neurotransmitters, its own
pathways. Memoriztion and forgetting are two separate active processes.

> Forgetting, the benefits of not remembering

Information is not stored into a atomic package. Almost everything has tags or
cues attached to it. When retrieving, we look for the tag first, and look at the memories associated with it.
When a cue has too many tags associated with it () our brains tries to forget them. This is called
`Transient forggeting`

example of tag overload
"
Who is abraham lincoln?

I remember being taught this.
I remember that it was by the new history teacher
It was on the bottom right side of my text-book
It was on christmas...
"

attentional control system

- grabs things from short term memory and put them into the long term storage

The way to work around this is using `novelty`: New, uniqyue, strong cues == not forgetting
e.g. Drop

> Could this explain why multi-modal learning is more efficient?

A huge promotor of forgetting is learning.
Some new information overrides the old ones.
This is called `Proactive Inhibition`

- When there is an intereference of previous learning that leads to forgetting.

How to avoid this? Not by not learning, but by being strategic about cramming.

- night before cramming: only revise-cram
- long-term cramming: add mini-recall ( link new info with the old one )

memories are meant to enable better `decision making`.
This is called `conceptual memory`.
"It can be very powerful:  ideas connect so well that they end up collapsing and taking less space on our brains"

> Chunking?

Vertical learning:
Given an topic , and then details about it. This isn't good because it remains as one discrete thing.
Horizontal:
breadth-first. e.g. taking one characteristic of a disease, then group with
other conditions with that same characteristic.
\> grouping, priming

Experts in a field are better on memorizing information about that field than a complete novice

> chess players memorizing positions

some times, memorizing things well comes down to having less to remember.

- people seeing things for the first time will have no intuition, and see a lot of new information .

> Having these mental models, ontologies, comparations, sortings help with learning.

[Learn faster and retain more than your friends | E3 Bigger Plate - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA8E0rYQcFY)
The method of learning that is most usual ( learn, write note, revise notes,
apply information ) is relatively modern. It comes about from the creation of
formal education and schools.

Imagining a world in which we only learn through experience
We usually don't learn unless it is relevant to a problem that needs to be solved.
The modern way is pretty artificial.
The brain does not want to keep information that is purpose-less

> Forgetting is an active process.

The first step is to increase the relevancy of what you're learning right now.

> 11:20 to jump straight to the point. His point is that we should begin
> experimenting based on reality and only after try to theorize what happened
> instead of the opposite way around. So the first step is to have an

[Your teacher can't help you... @CajunKoiAcademy - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmhBLmZWhPM)

How can teachers help with making note-taking easier?
Most uni teachers don't have educational experience, they're not necessarily
invested in being a better educator

In schools, its different, but they're usually over-worked

unless 1:1, it is not realistic , they're not gonna deliver information that is
perfect for you.

`Learner self-regulation`: ability to override all kinds of external variables.

Teachers and educators should spent less time on optimising delivery, but more
time helping students navigate difficulties and their curiosity.

Don't:
"What relationship are you thinking of" -> How you're trying to think about that relationship
"Did you group it in this way?" -> How are you trying to group it?
"Did you think about it the right way?" -> What thought processes are you engaging to navigate this information

[4 Reasons Hard Work DOES NOT Beat Talent - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRHTEhQp1g0)

Why hard work rarely beats talent. There are two missing ingredients

Formula for sucess => `Sucess = HardWork * talent * ( __ )`

Hardwork can be futile -> Stress, Pressure, Anxienty

1. Hardwork has diminishing returns
2. Effort is fuel. -> If the amount of effort you were putting in is
   reasonable, and you're not getting cnsistent results, you probably should
   get better methods.
3. Effort vs Output: When working hard, you want to build an 'asset' -
   Something that improves cash without doing more work. So, figure out how to
   work smart, and then feel free to work hard as well.

Hard work and talent are not the only variables in the equation. Formula for
sucess is really => `Sucess = HardWork * talent * processes`

> Talent is actually the natural ability for someone intuitively use more
> optimal processes.

1. Pull Back - If you're at 100% capacity, you can't spare the time to figure
   out how to work harder
2. Known more things - if you can't work smarter because you don't know how,
   then... learn to work smarter.
