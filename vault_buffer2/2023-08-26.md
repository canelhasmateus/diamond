- Think of the UUID as a number.
- Indexes are ordered. not ideal to insert random numbers;
  - When the page is full, but it is necessary to insert a element there, a `page split` needs to happen.
  - Pages are doubly linked, so there is a lot of updating around.
  - Depending on the implementation, also page fragmentation
  - Since we're touching around a lot of memory, we'll have some cache effects.

PadÃ© Approximations

- Approximate functions as `Rational Polynomials`.
- Both numerator and denominators can have different orders

Representation of Time Delay in dynamical models of systems.

> Controller Design -> Transfer Functions, Bode Plots, LQR , H\_infinity, Root Locus, Full state feedback, state space representation

You find it out by equating P\_m\_n( x ) = Taylor\_m+n( x )

"It makes sense thinking about it as transfer functions - given the same number
of states, a transfer function with ( poles + zeros ) produce more complex
behaviour than one with only ( zeros )"

1. How to determine m,n
   - Amount of delay, and speed of the system.
   - Phase matches the real function to an increasing frequency when increasing order.
2. Why limit ourself to m=n?
   - Only these affect only phase, but not gain . They act like an all-pass filter

An important question to answer when designing an autonomous system is how to
get the system to do what you want.
Control Systems -> Mathematical framework

u ( control inputs, Controlled ) -> System
d ( disturbances, Not Controlled ) -> System
System -> x ( States )

1. Can an algorithmn control the inputs without constantly having to know the current state of the system?
   - OpenLoopController / FeedForward Controller.
   - Generates the control signal by taking in the inputs by the reference, and never checks the state of the system.
     It is possible for the reference to require an specific state, but for that
     to work, we need to know the system. This can be derived from first
     principles, or fitted from data ( system identification )
   - Given an system model F(x), the feedforward controller can invert the
     function, and generate the required inputs from the reference. However,
     this needs a very detailed model of the system , and a very inert environment.
   - Errors build over time.
   - This is where feedback controllers ( closed loop ) come in.
     Feedback control is powerful but dangerous. Feedforward changes how we operate a system. Feedback changes the dynamics of a system
     `x' = f(x)`
   - A lot of control theory is focused on designing and analyzing feedback controllers, e.g : \[ Linear ( PID )  On-Off, Sliding mode, gain scheduling. ]
     - Not useful to categorize between linear and not linear.
     - Robust: Mu sysntehis,s Active Disturbance rejection control -> Focus on Meeting requirements
     - Adaptive: Extremum seeking, model reference adaptive -> Adapt to change to system over time
     - Optiomal: LQR -> Focus on balancing performance and effort by minimizng the total cost.
     - Predictive: Model predictive Control
     - Intelligent: Fuzzy control, Reinforcement learning
     - Other control methods. The choice depends on which system we're controlling and what we want it to do:
       What is the state we want our system to be in?
       What is the reference we want it to follow?
       The control system can't follow a reference if one does not exist. Planning is required and there are many methods e.g. Rapidly Expanding Random Trees and A\*
   - We need to know the state of a system, and doing that with a sensor
     introduces noise. In a feedback control system, the noise in the
     measurement actually affects the true state!
   - Observability: How to observe the states that are fedback? No need to measure it directly, just observe it ( e.g. no need for accelerometer as acceleration can be derived from speed )
   - State Estimation: Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, Running Averages. The choice of algorithmn depends on how much noise, and the type of noises that are present in those measurements.
   - Simulation, Analysis, Test: Make sure we satisfy the requirements: Bode Diagram, Nichols Chart, Nyquist Diagram.

- Breath Less
  - Breathing is about filling our metabolic needs.
  - Does not breath because of a lack of oxygen, but due to an abundance of co2
  - Breatholding creates an abundance of co2, and teaches the body to be more confortable with this, preventing overventilation.
- 5.5s  / 5.5s
  - coherence breathing

Four levels of reading

1. Elementary
2. Inspectional
   Picking up a book and be able to understand the nature of the book quickly. Skimming.
3. Analytical
   - Understanding what the book is about
   - What is the problems the author is trying to solve
   - are there any points of criticism
4. Syntopical
   - Combines multiple sources related to a topic

Reading is like the throw of a ball.
As the readers we must catch it
Authors may throw the ball terribly
We must still be able to catch the ball.

Focus
When attention works and when it falters
attentional blinks
We're not unfocused, we're just overfocused on other elements
Open monitoring -> Open gaze thinking and analysis

Visual has two modes of view

1. high levels of focus
2. Panoramic vision -> Dilated Gaze

Medidation

Learning is a two-stage process.  Cycle of FOCUS -> REST

1. Active engagement and focus
   - Much of the trigger of neuroplatiscity as a process is engaged by
     dopamine, noorepinephrine and acetilcoline
   - acetylcoline control contraction of the muscle, but in the brain it works
     as a highlighter.
2. Consolidation ( Sleep )

Gap learning effects

- If every couple of minutes you step out of focus and do nothing for like 10s,
  just idle and relax, learning goes up .
- Also work with NSDR ( Non sleep deep rest )

Some tools, such as caffeine, L-tyrosine help with the trigger part, but not
with the rest part.

No burning out when studying

1. The principle of energy management
   burnout = state of extreme physicial, emotional and mental exhausted
   caracterized by a decrease of motivation and performance.
   Productive studying = time \* ( efficiency of techniques ) \* energy

2. Scheduling for sustainability
   Not ramming engine at the *limit*

3. Strategies for study efficiency Optimisation
   - Environment
   - What are the times in which you feel more energized, and pair it with
     according practices.
   - Topic balancing and variety

4. Evidence based active wellbeing management practices
   - Sleep
   - Daily Movement
   - Meditation
   - Sunlight and nature
   - Nutrition
