# CognitiveLoading

A theory on how [[Encoding]] and [[Recall]] works. [^3]

It states that the encoding process creates overarching mental models inside the long term memory.
These are called [[Schema]]s.

Schemas are loaded into the [[WorkingMemory]] , through [[Recall]].
[[Encoding]] is then performed, by associating the new bits of information to the already known nodes of the schema.

Encoding is proportional `cognitive Load` , up to a certain point.

```ascii
    ENCODING
    ┼    ╭───────
    ┤   ╭╯
    ┤  ╭╯
    ┤ ╭╯
    ┤╭╯
    ┼╯----------- COGNITIVE LOAD
```

## Kind

The effort done Cognitive load can be split into three kinds:

1. Intrinsic

Simple topics require little while complex topics require large amounts of space.
Total complexity is fixed, but [[Chunking]] can be used to reduce those into
manageable sizes and to speed up how fast the brains picks it up.

> The actual "storage size"  of the new information,
> and the required effort to load it into memory.

2. Extraneous

Information not relevant, such as method used and channel noisiness.
Reducing extraneous load is the primary role of teachers, whether they know it or not.

3. Germane

Creating a schema for new info, and integrating it into existing knowledge

`in order to learn more effectively, the limits of the working memory must be respected, and few pieces of information must be put at a time`.

> The actual growing of the edges that links the nodes.
> Notice that this encompass both:
>
> - edges from new nodes to the already known schema
> - edges from new nodes to new nodes
