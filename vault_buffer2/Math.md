PadÃ© Approximations

- Approximate functions as `Rational Polynomials`.
- Both numerator and denominators can have different orders

Representation of Time Delay in dynamical models of systems.

> Controller Design -> Transfer Functions, Bode Plots, LQR , H\_infinity, Root Locus, Full state feedback, state space representation

You find it out by equating P\_m\_n( x ) = Taylor\_m+n( x )

"It makes sense thinking about it as transfer functions - given the same number
of states, a transfer function with ( poles + zeros ) produce more complex
behaviour than one with only ( zeros )"

1. How to determine m,n
   - Amount of delay, and speed of the system.
   - Phase matches the real function to an increasing frequency when increasing order.
2. Why limit ourself to m=n?
   - Only these affect only phase, but not gain . They act like an all-pass filter
