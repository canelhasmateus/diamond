Biohacking

1. Metabolismo energetico

- no caso de falta de energia, o corpo necessita priorizar

2. Metabolismo neuroquimico

- capacidade do organismo produzir os 6 hormonios
- glutamato
- gaba
- dopamina
- serotonina
- acetilcolina

3. Mindfullness

- Talamo -> Atenção

4. Organização

- Mudanças comportamentais

___

Ocupação vs Produtividade

___

Habitos negativos podem ser substituidos através da implementação de habitos positivos mais fortes
Esses devem ser implementados de forma gradativa
O inicio do dia é propicio pra fazer reprogramações.

___

Habitos simples -
Ganhar dopamina vs Noradrenalina Recompensa correta para o habito
Reconhecimento das recompensas feedback neuroquimico -
e.g No caso da academia, a recompensa em curto prazo não seria um bom fisico, mas mudanças em
facetas como energia, disposição e humor

Desistencia vem do desbalaceio excessivo entre Noradrenalina vs Dopamina

Mensurar uso de tempo por atitudes -> log screen time

___

divisão / planejamento do dia - Either

Por horarios
Por blocos
Misto

___

Iniciar e finalizar blocos de atividade em ciclos
Evitar multithreading

Ambientes corretos são capazes de moldar a ativação de certas regiões
( showtime effect )
`Eu contextual`
"Evitar estimulos visuais, auditivos" -> `mis en place`

`distorção ironica do desejo`

___

Apice da sofisticação é a simplicidade

___

KDDs

Organizing Principles:
None -> Relations -> Taxonomies -> Ontologies ( Relations of Relations )

> Cant help but notice the similarity to `Functors` and `Natural Transformations`

- Graphs -> Property Graphs -> Labeled Property Graphs ->

For example, algorithms could use the taxonomy
to compute semantic similarity between products by applying standard taxonomy
metrics like `path similarity`, `Leacock-Chodorow`, or `Wu and Palmer`.

___

Layered Ontologies:

"Custom ontologies" : "Recomendation", "Compatibility"
\-> Ontologies / Taxonomies :  "Product Classification" , "Promotions"\
\-> Instance Data : "Product Catalog"

`Ontologies make knowledge actionable`.

___

Adopt existing ontologies

<https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcc.html>
<https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology>
<https://schema.org/>
<https://www.dublincore.org/>

If creating one, denote ontologies in existing languages

RDF Schema
Web Ontology Language
Simple Knowledge Organization System

___

Sleep
\-> Memory consolidate
.. Living fills the short term memory
.. during sleep, it gets consolidated into long term memory
by means of your thalamos

Why consistent learning beats cramming?
14h in a day vs 1 hour in 14 days
\-> The second one leverages the process of consolidation.
In the first scenario, it is as if we dropped data from ram before being able
to commit it to disk

When we go to sleep, our brain focus on getting rid of some kinds of informations
Brain prioritizes delearning as long as we're emotionally activated

How do that plays alongside the other stuff Yung said?

___

Yoga nithram
Inducing a state of trance
\-> Go far into the sleep state but conscious
hipnoyogig state: Induce a no-mind state where you retain conscious awareness

How to optimize short term memory for long term consolidation?

- Review the same material at least twice in one day, ideally four hours apart.
- The brain prioritizes delearning, so having negative thoughts before sleeping
  is very bad

deadlines are really important for cognitive productivity during sleep
