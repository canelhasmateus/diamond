Type safety does not matter.

What I mean is that, on its own, type safety is not important. It's only useful
because of what it accomplishes: moving errors from runtime to compile time.
Even that isn't a goal on its own. The real goal is reducing runtime errors.
Type safety is one of the best methods of achieving these cascading goals, but
it's far from the only one.

Active Learning

1. Concepts
   \-> Ideas that can be attached to other ideas and grow understanding

People confuse learinng with taking notes

> proxy metrics

Your notes are supposed to facilitate the things in your head;
Express the information as closely as it is in your head;

Conceptual Framework

You want to synthesize things such they're not new information; e.g. ( acute
abdomen, apendicitis , bow obstruction), you want to think about these in the
same way.

1. Can create analogies
2. categorize and group information - aren't always  good; The creation of
   groups do not mean the contents are logically bound together ; you should
   try to group by "why"

Reverse goal settings
What is the type of person that would allow to achieve that goal? Then create
goals that allows you to become that type of person

> Great Mental Models: Reversion

Bridge the gap between the outcome and process.

Priming is giving yourself an understanding of what you're about to learn; the
skeleton;

" Very frequently, when studying, People try to construct this human from the
skin inwards "

> Draw the rest of the fucking owl

1. Deeper Learning
2. Active Learning
3. Threshold concepts:
   core concepts in a subject whe4re understanding these sujects is key to
   transforming the way a student understand the whole subject

allows to access an entirely new way of looking at things;

learning is recursively;

- You don't learn perfectly the first time.
- go back to learn it again and again, ; certain things make more sense when
  you've learning already , some details that did not make sense now do;

Excursive Approah

- being in a journey with an outcome that has allowances for diversions.

Active Learning is a way to tap into tthese threshold concepts, and includes,
but is not limited to class polls, quizzes group discussions, game based
learning

Techniques and examples

1. Include Priming ( Pre-study )
2. Event
   Drowsy, sleepy,  -> It takes effort to be engaged with the information
   Ask questions ( even if only inside head ); why and how questions are
   usually better to relate it back to the big picture
3. Revision
   The more you wait the more you're going to forget; this first window  is
   very important, revising it in the same day gives disproportionately higher
   benefit than doing it in two days.
   Ideally before going to sleep, to take advantage of `sleep dependent memory
    consolidation`.
4. Good revision techniques accentuate the `relationship` of these details
   back to the big picture. ->> Mind Map
   Using multimodal channels can be better. Using too much words reduce
   `cognitive load`; ->> Delayed note-taking
5. Last minute revisions - Use `recall`, not recognition based learning.
   Try to learn things different every time.

Bloom's taxonomy
levels of knowledge mastery

1. Memorise
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

( 1,2 ) are low-levels of learning.
