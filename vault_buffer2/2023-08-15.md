Is your application IO-bound or CPU-bound?

CPU metrics on top:

- u.s: User process. A percentage of all the cores in the machine of how much
  cpu usage *user* processes have used.
- s.y: How much time the cpu has spent on *system* operations. ( Kernel mode,
  Syscalls )
- ni : Tag processes with specific priorities. Everything that is > 0 increases
  this.
- id : Idle.
- wa : Waiting. ( IO operation. specific from disk )
- hi: Hardware Interrupts
- si: Software Interrupt
- st: Steal - On virtualized environments, with multiple os on the same
  machine, some cpu can be stolen by other processes.

Even with 100% cpu usage, this does not mean that other processes are being
starved. In order to reach that conclusion, we need PSI It stands for Pressure
Stall Information.

Nice Values

- default is 0
- greater means less low-priority.
- `u.s` does not count nice processes, while `ni` does in top.

You can use `nice` to start a process with a certain nice value, and `renice`
to change it mid run.

- You can decrease your priority, but not increase it ( w/o admin rights )
