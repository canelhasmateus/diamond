1. Expanding surface lexicon
   Surface lexicon vs deep lexicon
   Surface is the one we default to. ( 1500-3000 words )
   Deep is the one we know and recognize but might not be the first one we reach out to. ( 25K 30K words )
   How to access the deep lexicon?
   1. Repetition ( 38 times to register in the surface lexicon )
   2. Give yourself more time to indexyour deep lexicon
2. Command the pause
3. Prune filler words:
   - Like, Totally, Literraly, Irregardless, Basically, I feel like, A ton,
     Amazing, Interesting, in my opinion, absolutely, or something ,Â right, no
     brainer, cool, any way shape or form, whatever, awesome, basic, bunch,
     essentially, pretty much, legitimatelly , win-win, bive, full blown,
     personally.
   - Process the endings of your words
   - Keep your mouth closed until you are ready to speak
4. Take inventory of language input
   - Recognize that our speech reflects the language we interact and allow
5. Tune your vocal instrument
   - We undervalue the significance our voice holds
   - Pitch, Volume, Speed, variation
   - Melodic , words as notes
   - Read poetry out-loud

Better pronunciation

1. Pencil between teeth
   Pronounce "li li li li li li"
2. Smile broadly and move your lips actively

___

1. Rate of speech
   Modulate, Vary
2. Volume
   Authority, carisma, energy
   Most people speak at 3/10, just do 5/10
3. Pitch
   Melody makes memorable\
   Music can trigger a variety of emotions, yet there are no words - How do you know how to feel?
   Speech has an backing track
4. Tonality
   Emotion beneath your words
   Your face is the remote control for the emotion that lives beneath your words. Resting bitch face
   Six core human emotions - Happy, Sad, Disgusted, Fearful, Angry, Surprised
   Monotone voice is a product of a monotone voice - face is part of your body
5. Pausing
   Gives listener time to process
   Gives speaker time to think

Communication and influence

Story-telling chemicals

1. Dopamine
   Increases focus
   Increases attention
   Increases retention and memory
   Increases motivation
2. Oxytocin
3. Serotonin
4. Endorphin

> What is the difference between focus and attention?
> "I fundamentally believe in record and review"

"Efficient Student"

- Covers what is needed in a short amount of time

Efficiency follows this pattern

Encoding and retrieval

- Buckets with holes can be patched with encoding
- Information will always be forgotten in some form. One of these common forms
  is because of `Retrieval Failure`: Information that was encoeeded but is
  forgotten because of a lack of retrieval.
  How well it was encoded affects how much time is necessary until this failure
  mode: As encoding gets better, we need *less* retrieval ( not none )

What is the most powerful study trick?
efficiency: the time it takes to reach the level of knowledge mastery (bloom, solo taxonomy) we need

e.g. learn year 9 biology: Work your way down  : Take some phd thesis ( 3 ) ,
read those first, try to understand them as much as we can, and understand what
the core principles are; track your way back to uni, then back to h.s and then
year 9

- This does not make real sense. We are doing something similiar ( to a smaller
  scale ) when studying. Even in a single page, or in a single category, there
  are pieces of info that are at different levels.
- There is no way for the book to know what you'll know. *You* need to do the sorting.
- So, you should start with "cursory read": Skip anything that takes longer than , say, 2 minutes. -> ( Source material | Skipped elements | Notes )
- The tendency to try to just rote memorize it is a sign that you should skip it.

> " `Framing Bias`: The way the information is presented to us influences the way we think about it. "
> " `Anchoring bias`: The order and way in which we are exposed to new information influences what we think about other information after it"
> "This is called `order control`"

better `yield`:
There is no shortage of resources, but the way in which they are used is suboptimal

Higher order learning has trickle down effects to lower-order processes, but not the other way around

How to level-up the strategy?

Before checking the answers, rate your confidence.
Classifying the confidence makes it more obvious that some weakness was found, when finding out something was low-confidence
This pattern of thinking is something that you're weak on.
Create a `model answer`: expanding on this question.
Then check your `model answer` to the actual one.

> "for each question you answer, you should be able to answer 10 variations of that same question"
> `Misinterpreted effort hypothesis`: Students feel more effort in a strategy, and will veer away from it, because they think that it means that it is something wrong

More Focus:

1. Set a goal. An hour before bed, make a plan for tomorrow but keep it simple
2. You can procrastinate - In 10 minutes -

> Surf the urge

3. Take 10 minutes of break for every hour of focus

Students see motivation as inherent, fixed attribute they see motivation as a
driving influence/force that power every single behaviour The problem with this
overall mindset is that "you use motivation on simple day things", which burns
it up. So you're always looking to add up motivation and add more fuel, which
is not sustainable.

How do we create systems of working and productivity which are not dependent on
motivation.

> "What if we have uninteresing topics?"

2 types of motivation

1. External
   - Videos,
   - teachers,
   - poster
2. Internal
   - Derived inherently from within ourself. Such as a sense of identity. People
     don't usually see themselves as a learner
   - The task. e.g. Gaming .
     What part of this are we not finding motivating?
   - inherent interest on the subject
   - process interest
   > Stop looking at the destination, and look at the path
   > \-> Most people like getting knowledgeable at subjects, but they conduct learning in a way that is boring

Motivation is not the issue, it is the problem.
The solution is not to force yourself to do something that sucks, but make it
not suck in the first place.

We should try to derive more from the internal sources

> "Try to find out the *specific* reason why you're de-motivated. For most students, the demotivation factor is the process of studying , not the learning itself. "

Relate the information to prior existing knolwedge: `analogous relationship`

Space Repetition vs Interleaving

Interleaving is not a single thing

- Instead of Massed Practice

- Basket shooting: break up in angles

- Make your own questions,

- create with friends,

- Make your own answer sheet

The mindmap is not a single technique.
`Human cognitive architecture`

> " As Justin says, there are multiple ways to categorise any set of concepts.
> So how do you choose between them? My strong suggestion is to structure each
> map as an answer to a question - an explicit question that you write on the
> sheet of paper at the outset."

1. Grouping of information

- It makes sense to group it in multiple possible ways

Fundamnetal principles of learning

- cognitive load theory
- Intrinsic / Extraneous Load
- Generic Cognitive skills
- Generation Effect
- Hypercorrection Effect
- NoteTaking
- Storage of information
- Encoding
- Deep processing
- Retrieval
- Spacing
- Expanding gap expancing intervals
- Interleaving
- Massed Practice
- Flashcards
- Cue-utilization framework
- Effort as cue reponse
- Active vs passive learning
- Priming
- Knowledge Schemas
- Inquiry-based learning
- Time and Energy management
- Prioritisation Frameworks
- Motivation
- Seligman's positive psychology
- Kolb's Experiential learning cycle

1. Make your mind map is an accurate reflection of your thought process.
2. Do no avoid the thinking process of cleaning up the information and organising it.

Notetaking
should be a visual representation of your thought process

What should be accomplished?

1. Document information for later reference
2. Facilitating the right cognitive processes

Intuitive != Logical
