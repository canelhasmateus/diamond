[Why the Pomodoro Technique REALLY Works - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y2XrFLg4cY)

Pomodoro
25 min workclock, followed by 5 minutes rest clock.

"We're often to caught up with the fact that it *is* effective to think about
*why* it is effective. It is also not *always* useful"
Extract the principles behind it.

[[Attention Residue]]

When you start a stask, your attention and focus is dictated by attention residude that is left behind the previous task
It is necessary to clean that away before starting the new one.

The time pressure from the pomodoro reduces the attention residue:

1. at the end of the time, knowing the upcoming break, our Brain is primed to
   wrap up that task cleanly so we can go into that break; In that break time
   any ligering attention residue can be cleanly dealt with. At the start of the
   next time , the residue has dissipated and does not negatively affects it.
2. Time pressure affects our ability to be distracted. The time cages in our focus.

clean beginning
Reduce distractions
Clean and intentional finalisation.

Limitations of the pomodoro

- breaks
- work length

The ideal time to work and rest is a combination that produces the highest
overall level of productive output over a time ( which is longer than a single
cycle of the pomodoro, e.g. a week, a semester )

When working, We want to work at the highest level of efficiency ( or close )
Stop working when you're not sharp anymore (e.g. 50% ) .  Pushing further means
we take longer recoveries

> Do not eat until you're full; eat till you're not hungry anymore.

The break time should be around 25% to 33% of the you were working for.
What should we be doing during that break?

- mindless browsing is not that good - it does away with the intentionality we
  set for ourselves, and breaks the attention residue rule.
- Rest intentionally. e.g. Meditation, or something that maintains your flow
  state such as being productive with housework or organizing your room, going
  for an stroll.

better `yield`:
There is no shortage of resources, but the way in which they are used is suboptimal

Higher order learning has trickle down effects to lower-order processes, but not the other way around

How to level-up the strategy?

Before checking the answers, rate your confidence.
Classifying the confidence makes it more obvious that some weakness was found,
when finding out something was low-confidence
This pattern of thinking is something that you're weak on.
Create a `model answer`: expanding on this question.
Then check your `model answer` to the actual one.

> "for each question you answer, you should be able to answer 10 variations of that same question"
> `Misinterpreted effort hypothesis`: Students feel more effort in a strategy,
> and will veer away from it, because they think that it means that it is
> something wrong

[My Most POWERFUL Study Trick (Any Subject) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY2GO1ML-Bo)

What is the most powerful study trick?
efficiency: the time it takes to reach the level of knowledge mastery (bloom, solo taxonomy) we need

e.g. learn year 9 biology: Work your way down  : Take some phd thesis ( 3 ) ,
read those first, try to understand them as much as we can, and understand what
the core principles are; track your way back to uni, then back to h.s and then
year 9

- This does not make real sense. We are doing something similiar ( to a smaller
  scale ) when studying. Even in a single page, or in a single category, there
  are pieces of info that are at different levels.
- There is no way for the book to know what you'll know. *You* need to do the sorting.
- So, you should start with "cursory read": Skip anything that takes longer than
  , say, 2 minutes. -> ( Source material | Skipped elements | Notes )
- The tendency to try to just rote memorize it is a sign that you should skip it.

> " `Framing Bias`: The way the information is presented to us influences the way we think about it. "
> " `Anchoring bias`: The order and way in which we are exposed to new
> information influences what we think about other information after it"
> "This is called `order control`"

Skimming first to gather context.
Rough outlines of the ideas / structure
While surface-reading, create some retrieval questions

- It is fine to have some fact-based questions, they help situate the mind.
- Do go for more deep work questions though.

It is possible to increase the processing speed of studying. However, it is very low roi
Understanding where time is wasted is a higher-yield idea.

1. Energy management ( lower focus throughout the day )
   - more frequent rests
   - rests that use different part of the brain ( interleaving )
   - get rid of distractions -> coherent environment. e.g. fold-out screen
2. There is a lot of time wasted/energy spent on trying to understand things
   that shoould not be understandable -> learning before you're ready
   - without an appropriate, pre-defined schema, there is not much to be gained.
   - break understanding into layers.
