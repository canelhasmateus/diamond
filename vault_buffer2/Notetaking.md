# OnNotetaking

Good notes have three qualities.
They are `Active`, `Atomic`, and `Connected`. [^1]

## Active

They should serve a purpose.
This means that the following can be a good template for a note:

- Question
- Evidence
  Anedoctes can be seen as evidence.
- Conclusion

> Useful template for [[Reading#Inspectional]].

## Atomic

They should answer a single question

## Connected

They can lead to other questions, as well as mention other answers.
