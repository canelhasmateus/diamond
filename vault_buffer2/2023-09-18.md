It is possible to increase the processing speed of studying. However, it is very low roi
Understanding where time is wasted is a higher-yield idea.

1. Energy management ( lower focus throughout the day )
   - more frequent rests
   - rests that use different part of the brain ( interleaving )
   - get rid of distractions -> coherent environment. e.g. fold-out screen
2. There is a lot of time wasted/energy spent on trying to understand things that shoould not be understandable -> learning before you're ready
   - without an appropriate, pre-defined schema, there is not much to be gained.
   - break understanding into layers.
