> Priming is the idea that exposure to one stimulus may influence a response to a
> subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention. The priming
> effect refers to the positive or negative effect of a rapidly presented
> stimulus on the processing of a second stimulus that appears shortly after

> Priming is one way that our brain connects our memories; When we see or hear
> a certain trigger, we make associations based on that trigger, without
> realizing it.
