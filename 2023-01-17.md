* What are the key concepts? take a step back and form a picture of the overall structure of the ideas.
    Cluster Scraps into piles
    sketch a mind map or visual outline
    Doesn't have to match any other structure other than your `own personal ontology`
* `write A broad note` which captures the `big idea` of one of these clusters
* `write finer-grained notes`. Look through the individual scraps and write notes which capture nuanced atomic ideas
* `connect`
* Revise

The generalization of the todo management is a reminder list.

On Discovery: <https://github.com/lifegems/obsidian-related-notes-finder>
This plugin matches on words - no ML necessary

This <https://github.com/SkepticMystic/graph-analysis> also does something similar.

1. Simililarity ( Uses Jaccard distance to measure similarity based on graph connectedness, where   |x| is node degree and |x & y | is number of common neighbors ) <https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/similarity-functions/#alpha-algorithms-similarity-jaccard-context>
2. Link prediction  ( probability that two notes should be connected based on their other connections in the graph ) <https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/adamic-adar/> , <https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/alpha-algorithms/common-neighbors/>
4. Co-Citations
5. Community Detection ( label propagation , clustering coefficient )

<https://github.com/akaalias/obsidian-journey-plugin> Does also something similar, in the sense of calculating paths between nodes.

___

<https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-charts>

Enables the creation of charts. This is a somewhat useful ( and not well supported ) feature for MD. Other containders are for example, vega-lite.

Enables PDF annotation.
___

<https://breadcrumbs-wiki.onrender.com/docs/Home>
Enables the creation of self made ontologies, alongside visual elements to navigate them .

___

On search, <https://github.com/jplattel/obsidian-query-language> has some good ideas about using some code blocks that output lists of files. Of course, <https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview> can't be not mentioned.

___

On spaced repetition, <https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition> seems to implement ok functionality
