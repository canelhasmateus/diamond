"hey, I appreciate the contribution! I found some things troublesome with it, so I put it on the back burner because I wanted to discuss it with you. Have some time for a chat? I have some ideas for improvement!"

I was recently thinking about the merits of role-based discussions.
not limited to  here - but life in general, althought it seems more geared towards corporate settings
Many meetings / reunions , from my point of view and experience, suffer from a lack of tangibility. 
Usually, "Free-Flow" style meetings either are too shallow - requiring other meetings - or too tangential , especially when trying to resolve conflicting point of views.

The idea is that introducing structure may help, e.g: https://wiki.c2.com/?SixThinkingHats

TL;DR:

	Set up a sequence of hats, such as blue -- red -- yellow -- black -- white -- green -- red -- blue
	Each hat correspond to a kind of thought, e.g: 
		Black == Pessimistic ; White == Optimistic ; Red == Gut Feeling ; Grey == Just Facts ...
	Everyone simultaneously puts on each hat in the sequence and try to produce thoughts of that kind.
	If two contradictory thoughts pop up under the same hat, that's fine: both of them are put down in parallel and the contradiction is resolved later.
	At the end of the sequence you should have a balanced set of information that you can base a decision on.


The  main ideas here are:

	. Encouraging people to disengage themselves from their arguments.
	. It provides a discipline to ensure that the issue under consideration is seen from many sides.
	. Prevents arguments by keeping everybody under the same hat at the same time; resolving these issues is defered to a more appropriate moment in the discussion.



Does anyone have any experience with this kind of "Structuring"? Not necessarily this one, but any kind, even tangentially - such as those scrum / restrospective thingies
What are your thoughts about them?
