# ProblemFrames

An important part of solving problems is looking at them the right way \[\[Categorization]].

The `read-list` situation becomes easier to manage when looking at it as a stream.
Thinking of it as a stream lends itself to being handled just like any other stream.
Thinking of it as an application of \[\[DataEngineering]] buys us the scheduling, composition and \[\[FaultTolerance]] handling of the processes in the space.

The same goes for the flowtime situation: Thinking of it as a scheduling problem looks like the right abstraction since \[\[GanttChart]] fit this application perfectly.

The same goes for the whole Gnosis mentality. Working locally with text buys us the simplicity, flexibility and ease of use necessary to embed this as part of our life, instead of being a source of stress and emotional pain associated with most chores.
