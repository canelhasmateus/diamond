# Wishful Thinking

# Implicit Assumption

One such examples is to blindly look at averages, without the explicit realization that an average is supposed to be an representative value of an population. 
However, the average is only a expected value of an normal distribution, that is: 
    . thinking of the average as a representative value implies that the distribution is normal.

    Don't make the demo look done
    The appearance of the presentation should reflect the level of polish-ness of the results. 
        "Its very possible that what you are dreaming of is simply not possbile"
        "When you build up expectations and you aren't able to meet them you look pretty silly"
    
    i think the keywords here are
        expectations
        assumptions

    managing them is good for both you and your peers. 
        "Show them something polished and pretty, and you'll get feedback on font sizes. The reviewers make incremental tweaks, blinded by  what is in front of them. But show a napkin sketch, and they don't just see what's there, they see what's possbile. you need to tell reviewers about the kind of feedback you do
        want at this stage. "
        "If you want big picture, make it fuzzy!"

One obvious force at work here is the visually engaging nature of beautiful imagery. I believe another, subtler issue is that people unintentionally calibrate their criticism according to their impression of where you are in the development process. A highly polished image may look like a screen shot of an implemented UI, or at least the result of many weeks' work, leading someone to assume that only small details can be changed at this point. Even if you repeatedly remind them that the design is just an early sketch, they may still demur from suggesting anything so bold as starting over. People may also have difficulty criticizing a design if the representation seems far beyond what they could have created themselves.
