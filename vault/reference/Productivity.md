# Embrace the monkey Brain

An important realization to improve productivity is to understand that not all activities are the same: They require and exercise different parts of the body and the brain, and work best when in different states of mind.


Its possible to take advantage of this fact to increase our productivity. We  usually have a set  of - not one - goals. Instead of picking a task and forcing our brain into the required state to do it we can pick the task accordingly to the current state.
    . This can be seen as a way of [[Problem Solving#Question the Premises | Questioning your premises]]
    . By embracing the monkey brain we practice [[Sympathy#Psychological]] torwards our very nature.

By working in some activity, its possible we our minds get tired of being into that state. We usually notice that by the distinct lack of productivity and motivation. So, by layering  different kinds of activity its possible to achieve better utilization of our time, and thus, better productivity [[theory.md]]

# Embrace Misery

A very common problem i face is the one where i get lost while doing things. To accomplish A we need to accomplish B, which requires C . . .

This is frustating and a time sink. Nothing is ever going to be great. 
Do the *bare* minimum to achieve functionality, and iterate from there.

What kinds of activities are there? [[expand]]
. SO we could categorize each activity into some number of axes. For example:
            Long/Short term gains: Dopaministic vs the other one
            Active/Passive action:
            Multi-Taskable | Requires sole atention; 
            ...
