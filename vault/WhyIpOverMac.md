# WhyIpOverMac

Why does the internet require [[IP]]?
Why we can't use [[MacAddress]]?

Because mac addresses are random, that is, not routable.

Without the luxury of ordering and hierarchies to cut down on the search space, a request to a mac address would need to scan the entire internet. [[BinaryTree]]
