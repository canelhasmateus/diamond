BGP
    Protocol that makes the internet works
    The internet is a network of networks which is broken up into hundreds of thousands of smaller networks known as autonomous systems ( AS )
    Essentially a large pool of routers run by a single organization
    Autonomous systems typically belong to ISP or other large high-tech organizations: Tech companies, universities, government agencies and scientific institutions
    Each AS wishing to exchange routing information must have a registered autonomous sytem number ( ASN )
    IANA assigns asn to RIR's
    RIR's assign them to ISP and network
    ASN's are 16 bit numbers between 1 and 65534 and 32 bit numbers between 131072 and 4294967294
    As of 2018, there are approx 64000 asn in use worldwide
    ASNs are like "IP addresses" - assign them to routers
