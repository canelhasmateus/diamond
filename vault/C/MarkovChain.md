What would be the difference between markov chains and DFAs?

    . DFA's models the change in mode from a input perspective
    . Markov chain puts it in a more statistical perspective

Where does NFA's enter here? need to understand them better.

"Markov Property:
    The future state of the system is based only on the current state of the system"
