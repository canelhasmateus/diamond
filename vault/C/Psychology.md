## Proxy Metrics 

<https://erikbern.com/2015/06/05/the-hardest-challenge-about-becoming-a-manager.html>
I think what happens in your brain is you create all these proxies for accomplishments that take years to retrain. I would be incredibly costly if every action was judged in terms of its benefits amortized over your entire life time. Instead, we humans have an ability to invent pretty arbitrary proxies, such as getting high scores on exams, or in my case, write shitloads of code.

Proxies are great because they let you make decisions much quicker.

After a few years of doing something very consciously (programming is good because I can build this cool game and show it to my friends) you build up this great rewards system (kind of like Pavlov's dogs?) that makes you feel good about it in itself (programming is cool because I feel good when I do it).

The problem is when your ultimate goal changes and your old proxies are still in effect.

## Meaning 

    On Sucess:
        Atlas struggle becomes everyday more real.
        Our real goal and fulfilment doesn't come from reach the summit, but from the pain of rolling the ball. Thus, suffering / struggle not only is necessary to reach our potential, it is the actual goal.

The crisis of meaning (  Jung )
    . The general neurosis of our times
    . The lack of meaning is a soul-sickness whose full extent and import out age has not yet began to comprehend

 Viktor Frankl
    . Ever more people have the means to live, but no meaning to live for

happiness is about the present moment, independentof other moments, whereas meaning links events across time, thus integrating past, present, and future ( IAIN McGilchrist)

How can we discover a meaningful life message
    . tap into the wisdom  of the old mythos
    . what is the use of a religion withtout a mythos, since religion means, if anything at all, precisely that function which linkws us bgack to the eternal myth?

    . contains truthes about the human predicament and the nature of psyche expressed in narrative form. 

    both logos and mythos are realms to discovering truthts, but their truths are of a different nature
        . logos teaches us how to cure a sickness
        . mythos teaches us how to cope with loss and death

"
Is not jesus a prototype of those who, trusting their inner experience, have gone their individual ways in defiance of the world?

____

Myth of arrival:
    . The myth that we're going to a point of permanence, somehow.

The mere participation in the activities becomes the reward itself.

it is the best approach for reaching the ideal situation whereby we can support ourselves by means of activities we find intrinsically rewarding. :
Many people dream of such a line, but few attain it due to the sole reason most people don't get very good at what they do.

Struggle free life:
    . Not a life the human organism is suited for
    . We're restless creatures - tied by mortal nature - and cannot be tamed by external success
    . Our restless can only be tamed through the continual exertion of effort towards ends we deem worthy.

"We measure ourselves by many standards [ ... ] But deeper than all such things, and able to suffice unto itself without them, is the sense of the amount of effort we can put forth. He who can make none is but a shadow; He who can make much is a hero.
"
