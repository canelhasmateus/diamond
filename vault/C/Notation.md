# Notation

Notation is indeed a very powerful / important and often undervalued concept.

It's not sufficient for a system of notation to have a way of expressing every result; it has to be able to express every possible computation.

> This seems very profound, but i have yet to fully digest  its meaning [[MetaExpand]]
    It seems to imply that a result is not simply the value of following its computations
    But what are computations, even? Or results. This question arrives even if we're not distinguisuing these two concepts.

Interesting to note that even today we do not have the proper tools to denote every single computation.
                .. Is a computation tied down to a 'Perspective'?  are there ways to convert between 'Pespectives' purelly mecanichally, by means of transforming their notations?

On a tangent, notation is just a form of representing the problem

> Is this relatable with [[DomainModeling]]?
