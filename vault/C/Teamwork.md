"Organizations that encapsulate people into layers r silos map nicely onto this through experiment. If you want to build a new feature,you ping-pong around to various specialists. Communications by document is the norm. Use cases are written in terms of a horizontal layer; Nobody seems to remember tgat the top of the stack is the entire universe as far as the user is concerned"

"Give me a proactive first class generalist in a siloed org and i will give you a high-leverage change-maker that's a linchpin for company success. They will be invited to every meeting, cut through ambivalence, see the big picture and make smart tradeoff. they'll lubricate the cogs of the machine in a way that an equally smart, but siloed, technical pro cannot."

The atomic unit of developer productivity ought then to be one iteration of the inner loop. The appropriate unit is not code quantity, but iteration frequency. We might call this unit of quantity developer hertz.

People learn differently.
Some of these learn by taking responsability - regardless of their learning method.
When this group of people are misguided, this behaviour goes out of its way.  - Their specialty turns into absorbing all the responsibility around them while leaving none for others , which results in self blaming in case of failures - While in the learning cone, they enter the blame spiral.

At the beggining of that spiral, their behaviours look good from the outside, and they get positive feedback for their responsible and accountable behaviour - This becomes a positive reinforcer for the blame spiral to grow. However, as it grows unmanagedly , they start to impact others. The blame absorber's spiral touches other people's learning cones and blocks them.

Moving back is possible - But one needs to be aware of the behaviour.
Developing midfullness is a difficult journey :: Marshal B. Rosenberfg's say to take responsibility for our feelings, not for every task.

"What other do may be the stimulus of our egelings but not the cause. When receiving a negative message we can

* We can blame ourservles ( blame absorbing )
* We can blame others
* We can sense our own feelings and needs
* We can sense others lfeelings and needs

The more we are able to connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond compassionately.
The framework rosen berg uses is connecting the feeling with the need by using a sentence:
"
I feel .... because i Need ... "

This enables the self blame to turn into an action item and fulfill the need of a blame absorber without getting them into the blame spiral.

Moving fast and breaking things is good, but there are moments wetr risk-averse approach is better.
Military system, railway signaling, nuclear reactor software ....
Usually these system have ssafety critical properties, or they are difficult to roll back in failures...

Bias for action
"Many deicidions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study"

Use a principles-first approach to think about the architecture and the logic of the code; However, use an applications-first approach while plannin ght edeliveries.

Many software teams seen to use kanban , scrum or naother iterative process. but often, they fail to align their releases with their iterations.

Define whose responsability is waht.
    . WHen there is a sense of ownership, people take evcerything seriously. When there is a loosely defined resopnsibility, it creates confusion and conflicts. Every action should have a directly responsible individual.

    Bruing just enough clarity to the future. 

Accept, aknowledge mistakes.
    With bias to action, you will have many mistakes.

As a leader, transform "thing i like to do" into "things we like to do"

Why can't this be done sooner
    . "Deeply understand the papraoch tou're taking, question it, find the gaps in your knowledge, and analyze the rists better so that you make an informative decision while moving faster. It doesn't ask yo reduce the orject quality or scope, its purely focused on undestanding the limitations.

There exists mulitple ways to split the work and deliver.
    . Technical design
    . Domain driven design
        .. Split problem into user joiurneys and business domain requirements instread of technical layers.

If we're able to answer "Because of the reason X and dependency Y that we have no toher choice", we're acting midfully.

Thinking in alternatives pushes us to focus on the problem rather than blidly loving the solution.

Getting lost in the decision making process
     Leaders either use:

     A lot of authority,

     Seek consensus

More often than not, they stick to one deicision making style for everyhthin => conflicts can haapen and the inflexivility in decision making is at the root fo vairous problems,

There are different sizes of decisisions;

Authroity is detrimental to everyone:
    When leaders givce commands in every decision, they include themselsves everywhere while preventings others from growing
    by veing involved in everything, they become blockers.

Relying in consnesus is a process that takes a long time.

"Consent decision making"
    . Instead of getting an "I agree", it looks to just not having any objections.

    . Looks more promising, but the more robusdt streategy is having the flexibility to se all of the above together. 

![](2022-04-02-16-18-23.png)

Each person style is different.
    .. Affected by personality, backgrounds, and previous work environemnts.
    . When confronted with a decision style that its not accustomed to , the indifvidual feels uncomfortable and gets annoyed by the approach.
    . When this happens, they m ight say "we're going to fast'
    . This is a leader's mistake. its a communications failure
        .. wrongful focus on speed vs correct action.

How to choose each one?
    . .Experience
    . Empathy,
    . Reading the air
    . Understanding circumstances.
Explaining the decision making satyle is preffered
    . Discussions never end without understadning the reasoning.

Bias torwards action while keeping the authority at the minimum.

Aligned autonomy is an ongoing struggle
    . "[ I feel free to act and fully engage] to [achieve a greater purpose]"

Air Sandwich
    . "Clear vision and future direction"
    .     ?
    . "Day to day action"

Hypergrowth
Politics
    . People are not clones, having different perspectives and interests. Its useful to start by being curious rather than assuming bad faith ; this is not equivalent to no politics

Most people assume they've communicated when they transmit, but there are four other states
    . Transmitted
    . Received
    . Understood
    . Agreed
    . Converted to useful action

CatchBall
    . Back and forth [ multiple ]
    . Not one-way
    . Big crowds doesn't generate back and forth.
        . "I'm Sure they know we're depending on them"
        . "We've marked them as a dependency in a spreadsheet that none of us regularly check"

Rhythm
    . Serendipity informality when small ; deliberate explicit when big
    . "The larger the meeting the longer it takes to get to depth"
    . we add people on the first place to have more perspectives.

Boundary Objects
    . Refers to an object ( physical or mental ) that allows groups with different goals to coordinate their actions
    . Facilitates real over fake alignment.
    . Examples
        . Metaphors
        . Flywheels ( ??? )
        . Design Hierarchy of needs ( medium.theuxblog.com/design-hierarchy-of-needs-the-prodct-owners-guide-29ceb28205ae )
        . Process / Journey Map
        . System Context Diagrams ( eg. C4 Model)
        . Cause and effect diagrams ( not great )
    . If its too simple, its misleading; if its too fancy, its confusing.
    . Balancing act - never done

Growth
    . Can't assume stable teams
    . Can't rely on cultural osmosis :
        .. The new-people outnumber the older
        .. Default culture becomes whatever people bring , UNLESS , you're much more deliberate about occupying that space.

        .. Presumptive splits don't do good. 
    . Make structure follow strategy 

Organic Org design
    . Wait for seams to appear
    . Nudge things apart
    . Formalize the split

Edgar Schein 3 Levels of culture
    . Artifacts
    . Espoused Belief and values
    . Basic Underlying Assumptions

Richard Rumelt Strategy kernel
    . Diagnosis
    . Guiding Policy
    . Coherent Actions

Systems Leadership ( Ian Macdonald, Catherine Burke and Karl Stewart)
    . Role Modelling
    . Systems ( Processes, tools, etc. )
    . Symbols ( )

If it hurts, do it more often
