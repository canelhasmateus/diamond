# Value Theories

There exist differing theories of value. Generally, they try to explain the exchange value or price of items.

* Why prices are as they are
* How the value of goods comes about
* How to calculate the correct price of goods and services

Examples are:

* Intrinsic theory of value

    > Things have value 'as is', by themselves.

* [[ Labor theory ]] of value ( Classical Economics)

    > the amount of labor necessary for the production of a marketable commodity, including the labor necessary for the development of any capital used in the production process

    What is being addressed are general prices - Not the specific price of a particular good or service in a given circumstance.

* the exchange theory of value ( Marxian Economics )

    >  The commodity has, at the same time, both a subjective material `use value` and a objective `exchange value` or `social value`.

* The monetary theory of value ( New Readings of Marx )

    > Money is the necessary appearance of value , in the sense that prices constitute the only form of appearance of the value of commodities.

* The Power theory of value ( Johathan Nitzan / Shimson Bichler )

    > Not possible to separate economics from politics - The quantification of power in prices is not the consequence of external laws ( be it natural or historical ), but is entirely internal to society.

    leads to some interesting dilemmas: There is, however, a causality dilemma to their argument that has drawn criticism: power is based on the ability of firms to set monopoly prices yet the ability to set prices is based on firms possessing a degree of power in the market.

* The [[ subjective theory ]] (William Stanley Jevons, LÃ©on Walras, and Carl Menger )

    > An item value depends on the consumer wants and needs. The consumer places a value on an item by determining the marginal utility or  additional satisfaction, and decides what that means to them.

    Useful for explaining [[supply and demand]].

    Since the subjective theory takes into account the marginal utility of an item in order to put a value on it, [[marginalism]] can be applied to it. So, topics such as [[marginal utility]], [[marginal rate of substitution]], and [[opportunity costs]] are at play.
