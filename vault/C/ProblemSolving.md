Bottom-Up Approach

* Solve sub-problems in increasing order
* Fill in a table of sub-problem solutions
* Compare several smaller solutions to determine the best solutions for the current problem

Dynamic Programming

* Divide into sub-problems
* Solve sub-problem recursively
* On each recursive call, Start by checking if it is already solved, finishing by caching into the table.
