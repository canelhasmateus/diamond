In classical economics, the value of an object or condition is the amount of discomfort/labor saved through the consumption or use of an object or condition (Labor Theory of Value).

in theory economic value is not dependent on the existence of a market - price and value are not seen as equal.

Karl Marx, for one, saw exchange value as the "form of appearance" [Erscheinungsform] of value, which implies that, although value is separate from exchange value, it is meaningless without the act of exchange.

In another classical tradition, Marx distinguished between the "value in use" (use-value, what a commodity provides to its buyer), labor cost which he calls "value" (the socially-necessary labour time it embodies), and "exchange value" (how much labor-time the sale of the commodity can claim, Smith's "labor commanded" value).

economists such as Ludwig von Mises asserted that "value" is a subjective judgment.

Prices can only be determined by taking these subjective judgments into account, and that this is done through the price mechanism in the market.

Thus, it was false to say that the economic value of a good was equal to what it cost to produce or to its current replacement cost.

In neoclassical economics, the value of an object or service is often seen as nothing but the price it would bring in an open and competitive market.

This is determined primarily by the demand for the object relative to supply in a perfectly competitive market.

Many neoclassical economic theories equate the value of a commodity with its price, whether the market is competitive or not.

As such, everything is seen as a commodity and if there is no market to set a price then there is no economic value.

The theory of value is closely related to that of allocative efficiency, the quality by which firms produce those goods and services most valued by society.

In such a case, market value has both objective and subjective components.

Economy, efficiency and effectiveness, often referred to as the "Three Es", may be used as complementary factors contributing to an assessment of the value for money provided by a purchase, project or activity.

* Economy: minimising the cost of resources used or required (inputs) – spending less;
* Efficiency: the relationship between the output from goods or services and the resources to produce them – spending well; and
* Effectiveness: the relationship between the intended and actual results of public spending (outcomes) – spending wisely.[5]
