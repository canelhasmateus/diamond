# MinimaxTheorem

The Minimax Theorem is a result in [[GameTheory]]. It states that every two-player zero-sum game has an optimal (possibly randomized) strategy for each player.

* It may not necessarily be the best if your opponent is being dumb, but it #maximizes your values without special #knowledge or #space to store #information about past play.

When Both players play a minimax strategy, the expected utility for player 1 is called the #value of the #game

* It is a unique number
