they have no time to filter / get to really know people

the hiring proccess is very expensive

* price( 500k up to 1m,
* process time from 6 to 12month
* interview time - at max 6h

two pillars:

* meaningful evaluation takes too long - needs to rely on proxies - and these proxies should be hard to imitate : these just take people out
* For system designers , the best way to know about these qualities, is to hear stoires

there are thus, 3 levels:

1. coding
2. system design - set of software components that work togethet to achieve an outocme that takes the coordintation of many people to design implement, test and maintain
    on the surface, look like sityuational, but are veily behavioral problems. Coding problems are situational.
3. Leadership : senior and principal engineers are responsible

start is too focused on what happened rather than developing the character - you

the point is to determine good match - proper history makes the interviewer invested in you.

"Man - in - a - hole"
start anchoring the story by *anchoring* your story in the status and responsibilities ( use terms from the job descriptoin)

* after this is established, layer in conflict. Thick.
* Don't overthink it

use start as a linter on your story - after you already crafted it - as a linter, to make sure it has substance

1. levels are relative to each company
2. ppor behavioral responses lead to down leveling
3. use u-story shape
4. imperfect success
5. no villains
6. use star to check
7. don't lie
