Network Address Translation

    Maps a ip address to another ip address
        ( or a ip_address:port pair to another one )
    
    Originally designed to solve the only 4bi ipv4 devices

    not only application
        . 

    

    devices inside the same network can communicate directly by finding each other mac addresses using arp

check if its in the same subnet, does an arp request
else, it calls its default gateway
    when rounting a request, the router will:
        check if its an unroutable ip addresses.

if
router vs switches?

can use to do more things
    . Instead of having root access to listen on port 80.

    . load balancing: takes the packets coming, and create a virtual ip addresses ( VIP ). the vip gets an entry in the nat table
