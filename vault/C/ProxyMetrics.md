I think what happens in your brain is you create all these proxies for accomplishments that take years to retrain. I would be incredibly costly if every action was judged in terms of its benefits amortized over your entire life time. Instead, we humans have an ability to invent pretty arbitrary proxies, such as getting high scores on exams, or in my case, write shitloads of code.

Proxies are great because they let you make decisions much quicker.

After a few years of doing something very consciously (programming is good because I can build this cool game and show it to my friends) you build up this great rewards system (kind of like Pavlov's dogs?) that makes you feel good about it in itself (programming is cool because I feel good when I do it).

The problem is when your ultimate goal changes and your old proxies are still in effect.
