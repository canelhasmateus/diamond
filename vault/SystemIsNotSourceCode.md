# SystemIsNotSourceCode

I have seen less-technical executives repeatedly assume that `the source code of a system == the system`. [[ImplicitAssumption]]

In other words, they think people are fungible and an architecture can be purchased and transferred *only* by shifting source code.

Grab a wad of source and plop it down in front of people who have never worked with it before: The institutional knowledge that **contextualized** the system in the minds of its creators is missing.
