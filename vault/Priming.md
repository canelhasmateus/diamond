# Priming

Priming is the idea that exposure to one stimulus may influence a response to a
subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention.

The priming effect refers to the positive or negative effect of a rapidly presented
stimulus on the processing of a second stimulus that appears shortly after.

Priming is one way that our brain connects our memories; When we see or hear
a certain trigger, we make associations based on that trigger, without
realizing it. [^1]

Priming is what we're aiming at with [[PreStudy]],
but not every pre study makes for effective priming. [^2]
