Array
	-> Two most primitive array operations are writing elemenbts into them, and reading elements from them
	-> All other array operations are built on top of these two primitives.
	
	-> There is a difference between the array capacity and its length.
		-> Capacity is the number of objects the array COULD hold, it it was full.
		-> Length is the number of objects currently in the array.
