Innatentional blindness can be a good thing. Being able to zero in on a particular block of code, to the excl usion of the guy sneezing on the next cube is healthyl. 

However, superb engineers have a capacity to see through the cloak of somebody else's problem; they think simultaneously o multiple levels of abstraction. They tend to ask "meta questions" that poke at larger issues, broader contexts aand more distant time horizons. 

"Seeklcts meta qestions that tes assumptions or uncover misalignments as rapidly as possible"


"Plenty opf problems don't merit deep t hinking. The zen master found time for our example iossue by judiciously ignoring others, even tih iportant issues, you don't have to think at all these levels all the time. just being aware of broader contexts and probing them ocasioanlly will bring benefits to your team.

"Organizations that encapsulate people into layers r silos map nicely onto this through experiment. If you want to build a new feature,you ping-pong around to various specialists. Communications by document is the norm. Use cases are written in terms of a horizontal layer; Nobody seems to remember tgat the top of the stack is the entire universe as far as the user is concerned"

"Give me a proactive first class generalist in a siloed org and i will give you a high-leverage change-maker that's a linchpin for company success. They will be invited to every meeting, cut through ambivalence, see the big picture and make smart tradeoff. they'll lubricate the cogs of the machine in a way that an equally smart, but siloed, technical pro cannot."

So, the "frustration" comes from not getting an expected result , nor a explicitly positive response

The second one cant be avoided - it is a slip- as you call

But when there is no intent for a result, there is no axis of calibration for success-ness

In the user design analogy, Its the equivalente of pushing buttons randomly for the sake of it
