Raising e to the power of a matrix


useful to solve a class of differential equations
    . The world  is written in terms of diff equations
    . Very common in quantum phycics


What is the operation of e ^ M?
    . Not a way to multiply e itself multiple times
    . We take advantage of the power expansion of e < Taylor Series >:
        e^x = Sum( 1/n! * x^n )
    . We can use this to exponentiate a lot of objects, such as imaginary numbers and matrix, that do not seem immediatelly sensical as exponents
    . Discovery vs Invention

As we add more and more terms, we eventually reach a "constant" value. 

What is this trying to do?

Two problems to matrix exponents. 
    . Juliet and Romeo examples ( Loves me, Loves me not )
        .. dx / dt = - y( t )
        .. the general goal of edos is to find explicit forms of y(t), that satisfy the inteded behaviour, alongside its initial properties
        .. Makes sense to package these values as a point in cartesian space. 
        .. The dx/dt here would be a"speed" vector that thugs this point to another location in space. 
Matrices as linear transformations 
    
"Rotation Matrices"
    . | Cos(T) - sin( T ) |
    . | sin(t) + cos( t ) |

This seems like a very good video to try and *really* understand what is going on.
