Type safety back and forth:
    Push Responsability forward with Maybe , but we can also push responsability back.
        . This is needed in order to provide totality in our functions
    
    When some piece of code hands us responsibility, we have two choices:
        Handle that responsaibility
        Pass it to someone else.
    
    Same thing as that "parse, don't validate"
