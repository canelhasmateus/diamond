Sampling methods

    Why 
        Approximate expectations
            Estimate Statistics 
            posterior inference ( compute probabilities)
        Visualization 
    

    Why expectations?
        Every probability is an expectation
        approximations are needed for sums and integrals
            most sums / integrals can be seem as expectations of some distribution. *

    Sampling methods
        Examples
            Monte carlo
            importance sequence
            sequecential importance sequence
        Pros: 
            Very easy to implement , when compared to exact inference        
            Very General Purpose
        Cons:
            Slow ( when compared to analytical methods)
                . Innapropriate for some problems
            Getting "good" samples may be difficult
                . ( What are good samples ? )
            Too Easy - Overused / used innapropriately
                . Not a cure all elixir.
