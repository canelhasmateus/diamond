# ComposingRevising

There is composing, and there is editing. \[\[ThinkingFastAndSlow]]
I understand composing to be additive, that is, whenever you compose, you add new stuff to your text.
Editing is mostly subtractive, though. You either move existing words around or remove clutter. You re-write, but you don’t add a lot of new things.

Doing both things at the same time wastes mental energy. It is a switch between creative and corrective work, like switching gears. This loses momentum and exhausts oneself. \[\[EmbraceMonkeyBrain]]

> \#todo how to compose / write better? are there any tips, systems, structures?
