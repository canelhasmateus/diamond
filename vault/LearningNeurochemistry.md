[[Learning]] works as a two-stage process in alternancy

1. Active engagement and focus
2. Consolidation ( Sleep )

Much of the trigger of neuroplatiscity as a process is engaged by

- [[Dopamine]]
- [[Noorepinephrine]]
- [[Acetilcoline]]
  acetylcoline control contraction of the muscle, but in the brain it works
  as a highlighter.
  > TODO: How so?

Some tools, can help with the triggering, but not with the rest.

- [[Caffeine]]
- [[L-tyrosine]]
