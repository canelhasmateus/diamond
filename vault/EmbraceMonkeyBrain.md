# EmbraceMonkeyBrain

An important realization: not all activities are the same.

* They exercise different parts of the body and the brain.
* Possibly work best when in different states of mind.

We usually have a __set of__ - not one - goals.
Instead of picking a task and forcing our brain into the required state to do it, we can pick the task accordingly to the current state. [[FirstPrinciplesThinking]] [[Duality]]

By working on some activity, it is possible our minds get tired of being in that state. We usually notice that by the distinct lack of productivity and motivation.

So, by layering different kinds of activity, it is possible to achieve better utilization of our time and thus better productivity.

    What kinds of activities are there?
    . SO we could [[categorize]] each activity into some number of axes. For example:
            Long/Short term gains: Dopaministic vs the other one
            Active/Passive action:
            Multi-Taskable | Requires sole atention;
            ...
