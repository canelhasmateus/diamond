what is the maximum number of tcp connections that a server can receive?
    A client can only have 65k connections to a server because of port reasons ( 16 bit )
    . This also applies for proxies and load balancers, since they are clients in regards to the backend serevr.

can layer 4 proxies use the http2 multi-channelling?
