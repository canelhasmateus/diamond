I have seen less technical executives repeatedly assume that the source code of a system == the system. In other words, they think people are fungible and an architecture can be purchased and transferred *only* by shifting source.  

Grab a wad o source and plop it down in front of people who've never worked with it before, the instituional knowledge that __contextualized__ the system
in the minds of its creators is missing.
