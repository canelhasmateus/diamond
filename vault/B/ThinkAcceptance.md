"
The shadow,m when it is realized, is he source of renewal ; when there is an impasse, and sterile time in our lives, despite an adequate ego development - we must look to the dark, hitherto unacceptable side which has been at our conscious disposal
"

"
awaken to the troubling idea that our portion of or personality is add odds with current morality and  with our family , peers and society judge as good and evil
"

"

Examine the morality we have been grow into;
its not that we must turn evil in the sense of turning criminal ; but in the sense of detaching ourselves from the flaws of our moral code so we can reconnect with the parts of our personality we lost to our shadow long ago.

This is not only normal, but essential; The achievement of independence involves the capacity of the ego not only to adopt the values of the collective but also to secure the fulfillment of those needs of the individual which run counter to collective values - and this entails doing evil.

By not being aware of having a shadow, you declare a part of your personality to be non-existent. If you get rid of qualities you don't like by denying them, you become more and more unaware of what you are, declaring yourself more and more non-existing and your devils will grow fatter and fatter.

First, one has to accept and take seriously the existence of the shadow. Second, one has to become aware of its qualities and intentions . This happens through conscientious attention to moods, fantasies and impulses. Third, a long process of negotiation is unavoidable
"

"
Do we experience a simmering anger for no apparent reason ?
Maybe we have recurrent fantasies, born from resentment, bitterness, self-hate ; Desire for destruction and revenge ;
In these cases, it is likely that we have not integrated our aggression into our conscientious personality;
to initiate such process, we can seek safe, controlled and productive outlets within we can act with more aggresion ( sport, martial arts , more assertive of our behaviours, inclined to stand our ground)

Most indivividuals, fearing the complex depths within, remain at the superficial and surfacer layer of their psyche ; industriouly mindful of their common comedy and not at of themselves

"What he wanted was totality ; he disciplined himself to wholeness, he created himelf. ~~ about Goethe"

"
the beast within
just as a raging river can be harnessed for its energy, so can the uncivilized layers of the psyche, if handled and channeled properly, can revitalize life.
"

"The mind as multiplicity - an aggregation of intertwined psychological entities

the most general picture of our essence is an association of drives ,with constant rivalry and particular alliances with each other.
"
like a city - numnerous conflicting subpersonalityies simultaneously live. how to harmonize the abundance of drives and impulses, and provide coordination between them? ->
    Organizing idea ; A dominant master drive thast forms the living entre of the psyche, and co-opts all the other drives to act in subordination to its idea
    ~ Is this an daemonic?

"
There is a false saying: How can someone who can't save himself save others?
Supposing i have the keys to your chains, why should your lock and my lock be the same?
