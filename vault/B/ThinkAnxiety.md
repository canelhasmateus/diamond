If we wish to escape from a life of passivity, stagnation and mediocrity, we must be willing to attend the 'School of Anxiety' - Has a demonic side that can ruin or life, but also a side that can guide us towards the development of a greater self.
    - Which one shows, depends on a large degree to how we approach the anxiety inducing situation of our life.
  
"

Unlike other creatures, who are ruled by instinct and necessity, we must "contend with our freedom."
    . Choosing among the possible paths, and taking the steps towards actualizing these possibilities leads to self creation - the ultimate task of man.
    .  "Man is a creature who is continually beckoned by possibility, who conceives of possibility, visualizes it, and by creative activity carries it into actuality. "

The trouble is choosing the path.
    . Possibility means "I can" - In a logical system it is convenient enough to say that possibility passes over into actuality. In reality is is not so easy, and an intermediate determinant is necessary. This intermediate determinant is anxiety.
    . Every step is patterned the same.
        .. Envision possibility that could further our self creation
        .. Experience the anxiety that accompanies the process of moving forward into a unpredictable and open ended future, but move forward regardless.

The capacity to bear anxiety is important for the individuals self realization and for his conquest of his environment. Every person experiences continual shocks and threats to his existence, indeed, self-actualization occur only at the price of moving ahead despite such chocks. This indicates the constructive use of anxiety.

"
In refusing to move towards the possibility that makes us anxious, we have made a faustian bargain. We gain some temp comfort in avoiding the challenge and remove the chance for failure.
"

"
Those who refuse to launch at into life must commit partial suicide - We must kill off the side of ourselves that desires self-actualization
"

"
No one is coming ;
to save me ; to make life right for me ; to solve my problems ;
the dream of a rescuer who delivers us leaves us passive and powerless.

"
One of the most important therapeutically effective factors if subjecting yourself to the objective judgement of others
"

"
Often those afflicted by anxiety , believe that if they can avoid the things that trigger their symptoms, then a relatively comfortable life is still possible - symptom management, rather than recovery becomes their primary goal.
"

"
Flight from life does not exempt us from the law of age and death. He who tries to wriggle out of the necessity of living winds nothing and only burdens himself with a constant foretaste of aging and dying, which must appear especially cruel on account of the total emptiness and meaningless of his life
"

"
What direction the patient's life should take in the future is not ours to judge; It is better to renounce any attempt to give direction and simply to try to throw into relief everything that the analysis brings to light , so that the patient can see it clearly and be able to draw suitable conclusions.

Anything he has not acquired himself he will not believe in the long run, and what he takes over from authority merely keeps him infantile. He should rather be put in the position to take his own life in hand.
"

"
There are many neurotics whose inner decency prevents them from being at one with present-day mo reality and who cannot adapt themselves so long as the moral code has gaps in it which is of the crying need of our age to fill.

They aren't ill because they haven't found a way to live live everyone else ; but because they have not yet found a new form for their finest aspirations ;
Some are born and destined to be bearers of new cultural ideals ; they are neurotic as long as they bow down before authority and refuse the freedom to which they are destined
"

Not everyone is in this category, however .
