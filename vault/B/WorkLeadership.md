Leadership principles

OwnerShip

* A leader must own the entire lifecycle of their decision
* Feel the pain, brainstorm the solution, get the proper stakeholder buy-in , help build the solution and prove it works now and in the future.

Bias For action

* Ponder the consequences, but not be indecisive

Invent and simplify

* Seek to improve
* push the boundaries of what can be created
* Humble enough to accept their own limitations and adopt solutions from others.

> The minimum amount of authority required.
