# ImplicitAssumption

Implicit assumptions are a common source of problems.
Many solutions undisclosedly rely on facts that may not be true.

One such example is to blindly look at averages, without the explicit awareness that an average is supposed to be a representative value of a population. There is the implicit assumption that the average is a representative or meaningful value, which is not true for all distributions.

\[\[FirstPrinciplesThinking]] is a frequent remedy for such behaviour.
