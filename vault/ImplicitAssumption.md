# ImplicitAssumption

Alongside [[PatternOversimplification]], implicit assumptions are a common psychological and mathematical phenomenon, frequently a source of problems since many solutions undisclosed rely on facts that may not be true.

One such example is to blindly look at averages, without the explicit realization that an average is supposed to be a representative value of a population.

Here, there is the implicit assumption that the average is a representative or meaningful value. This is only true of normal distributions, that is: We're implying we expected our use case to reflect [[DistributionNormal]].

> [[PatternQuestionThePremise]] a frequent remedy for such behaviour.
