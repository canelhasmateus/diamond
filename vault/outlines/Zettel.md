It is a very common [[ImplicitAssumption]] that the information of a text is given through its content. That is not the case: `Information is not an innate property of things in the world. It is part of our interpretation` [[InformationIsInterpretation]].

That is - to properly learn, it is necessary to *actively engage* with the material.

The necessary engagement can come about from diverse processes, such as writing [[WritingIsThinking]].
Another option to create associations - Linking things forces us to analyze and contextualize information[[ContextualizeLinks]].

This process of engagement should create an organic structure. It is common however for there to be different kinds of notes.
Some will contain factual information.
Some will contain interpretations.
Some will contains synthesis of interpretations.

Reading and writing with these in mind can be helpful. [[ClosedFrameworks]]
