# LayersOfEvidence

[Three Layers of Evidence â€¢ Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/layers-of-evidence/)

In a Zettelkasten - if done correctly - there will emerge layers of evidence. These layers represent the necessary processing steps from data of knowledge.

1. Data description and patterns
2. Interpretation of descriptions and patterns
3. Synthesis of patterns, descriptions and interpretation

* Divide those layers
* Read and learn with those layers in mind
