Bloom Taxonomy is a

It provides a [[UbiquitousLanguage]] for discussing and exchaning learning
assessments and methods.

The goal of an educator’s using Bloom’s taxonomy is to encourage higher-order
thought in their students by building up from lower-level cognitive skills.

Bloom's taxonomy
levels of knowledge mastery

1. Remember
   Recognize and remember facts. Not understanding of the meaning is necessary.

   arrange, define, describe, duplicate, enumerate, identify, label, list,
   match, memorize, name, order, read, recognize, relate, recall, repeat,
   reproduce, record, select, state, view, write

2. Understand
   Demonstrate understanding through summarizing and organizing

   classify, cite, convert, describe, discuss, estimate, explain, express,
   generalize, give examples, identify, illustrate, indicate, locate, make
   sense out of, paraphrase, recognize, report, restate (in own words), review,
   select, summarize, trace, translate, understand

3. Apply
   Usage of acquired knowledge in new situations

   act, administer, apply, articulate, assess, chart, choose, collect, compute,
   construct, contribute, control, demonstrate, determine, develop, discover,
   dramatize, employ, establish, extend, illustrate, implement, include, inform,
   instruct, interpret, operate, operationalize, participate, practice, predict,
   prepare, preserve, produce, project, provide, relate, report, schedule, show,
   sketch, solve, teach, transfer, use, utilize, write

4. Analyze
   Breaking concepts into constituent parts
   Identify motives and causes
   Making inferences

   analyze, appraise, break down, calculate, categorize, compare, contrast,
   correlate, criticize, diagram, differentiate, discriminate, distinguish,
   examine, experiment, focus, illustrate, infer, limit, outline, point out,
   prioritize, question, recognize, separate, subdivide, test

5. Evaluate
   presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information

   appraise, argue, assess, attach, choose, compare, conclude, contrast, core,
   criticize, critique, decide, defend, estimate, evaluate, interpret, judge,
   justify, predict, rate, reframe, select, support, value

6. Create
   putting parts together to form a whole or bringing pieces of information together to form a new meaning.

   adapt, anticipate, arrange, assemble, collaborate, collect, combine,
   communicate, compile, compose, construct, create, design, develop, devise,
   express, facilitate, formulate, generate, hypothesize, incorporate,
   individualize, initiate, integrate, intervene, invent, manage, model,
   modify, negotiate, organize, plan, prepare, progress, propose, rearrange,
   reconstruct, reinforce, reorganize, revise, set up, structure, substitute,
   validate, write

Some consider the three lowest levels as hierarchically ordered, but the three higher levels as parallel.
