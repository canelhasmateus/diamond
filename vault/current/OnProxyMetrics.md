# OnProxyMetrics

It would be incredibly costly if every action was judged in terms of its benefits amortized over your entire lifetime.

Instead, we humans invent pretty arbitrary proxies, such as getting high scores on exams, or in my case, writing shitloads of code.

Proxies are great because they let you make decisions quicker.

After a few years of doing something very consciously, you build up this great RewardSystem that makes you feel good about it by itself.

```mermaid

stateDiagram-v2
 note left of A
 Programming is good because   
end note

    state "I can build this cool game and show it to my friends." as A

    state "I feel good when I do it." as B


 A --> B: Pavlovian Responses
 B --> [*]
    

```

__The problem is when your ultimate goal changes and your old proxies are still in effect.__
