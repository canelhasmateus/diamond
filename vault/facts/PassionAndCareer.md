# PassionAndCareer

[Don't Choose Careers Based on PASSION - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Pp4VMRZKI)

Passion is not the only component to consider, nor the most important.
People who make career decisions based on passion tend to be less satisfied with
their jobs.
Passion is like a fire - bright and warm
You only need it when it is cold or when it is dark.

There is also Purpose and Personality.

- Purpose + Passion -> Values, Priorities
- Personality + Passion -> Experience
- Pupose + Personality -> Reflection
