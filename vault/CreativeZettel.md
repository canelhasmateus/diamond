[How To Use Creative Techniques Within the Zettelkasten Framework • Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/creative-technique-within-zettelkasten-framework/)

take one idea (X) and put it in the centre

imagine the four compass directions. each direction helps give definition to the idea in different ways.

NORTH: “Where does X come from?” what are its origin? what group/category does X belong to? what exists an order of magnitude higher? zoom out. what gave birth to X? what causes X

WEST: “What is similar to X?” what other disciplines could X already exist in? what other disciplines could benefit from X? what are other ways to say/do X?

SOUTH: “Where can X lead to?” what does X contribute to? what group/category could X be the headline of? what exists an order of magnitude lower? zoom in. what does X nurture?

EAST: “What competes with X?” what is the opposite of X? what is X missing? its disadvantage? what could supercharge X?

The Zettelkasten structure created around the idea could look something like this:

___

The zettelkasten is a framework within we think, carry thought forward, merge thoughts, or separate their components. That we write notes, create new ones and link them in the process is merely the physical or digital manifestation of our thinking. Link knowledge and not notes.

Choose an idea and place it in the center.
Think of each leaf as an aspect of the thought that is needed to fully develop it. The thought blossoms like a flower.

Truth: Are there arguments for its truth? Is there empirical evidence for its truth? Is it free of self-contradiction?

Relevance: To whom is the thought important? To whom is it not?

Usefulness: What problem can be solved by the thought? Can it become a tool?

Beauty: How does the thought promote harmony and elegance?

Simplicity:  How can you make the thought simpler and easier to understand? Can the thought be used to simplify something else?

(The resulting structure in your Zettelkasten, however, depends on the individual thought).

Closed creative techniques are usually questions or sets of questions that provide a direction of exploration from a known starting point.
Open creative techniques, on the other hand, are ways of exploration. An example of an open-ended creative technique would be to write a journal entry for a book character to get to know him or her better, or Mind-Mapping.
