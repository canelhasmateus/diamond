# OnMeetingRoleplays

I was recently thinking about the merits of role-based discussions.
not limited to any place, but life in general - although it *does* seem more applicable in [[AboutWorkplace]] settings.

The premise is that many meetings and reunions suffer from a lack of tangible value-added because they are:

* Too shallow
    Doesn't solve the point.
    Requires more meetings.
* Tangential
    Easily sidetracked - either by chitchat or by tempers.
    Hard to resolve conflicting points of view.

Introducing structure may help. From [[SixThinkingHats]]:

1. Set up a sequence of hats.
    Each hat corresponds to a kind of thought, that is
    Black is pessimistic, White is optimistic,
    Gray is just the facts, Red is [[GutFeeling]]...
2. For every hat in the sequence, the group
    __simultaneously__ wears it
    produces thoughts of that kind.
3. Discussion follows.
    Contradictory thoughts are put down in parallel, and resolving arguments is deferred to a more appropriate moment in the discussion.
4. In the end, there should exist a balanced set of information that you can base a decision on.

Why do it this way, though? The main ideas are:

* Encourages people to disengage themselves from their arguments.
    [[ThinkAttachment]]
* The structure ensures that the issue under consideration is seen from many sides.
* Prevents arguments by keeping everybody under the same hat at the same time
