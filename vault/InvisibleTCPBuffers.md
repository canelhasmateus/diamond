# OnInvisibleBuffering

Using tools such as \[\[ReverseProxy]] is easy, but it silently introduces a new \[\[TCP]] buffer. \[\[UnseenConsequences]]

Think of
The \[\[Cache]] spits out payload as quickly as possible, and the server sends data frames with the highest stream weight first. \[\[HTTP2]]

The \[\[LoadBalancer]] foils this, since, as long as its tcp buffer is not completely filled, the lb will accept more data from the server: This quickly drains the server buffer, but from there on out, the priorization does not work anymore.

```
    HOL blocking
        Http2 solves the http head of line problem, it still suffers from tcp hol blocking : 
            tcp buffers are serialized fifos. this means that , once something is in that queue , you need to download it before going to the next one
                .. Shouldn't multiplex solve this? 
```
