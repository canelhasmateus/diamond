# WorkMetrics

I think a lot of people's introduction to OKRs is John Doerr's book "Measure What Matters".

The book explains how Andy Grove introduced the practice at Intel and it was very effective. It seems to attribute the success to the practice itself and seems to say "if you adopt OKRs, you will succeed like Intel did".

I suspect that Andy Grove was probably an excellent manager and I think he could have succeeded with something other than OKRs.

I think he understood that what was important was to get everybody across the organization to focus on essentially one big goal.

He needed to make sure that everybody was pulling in the same direction and together, and OKRs provided a tool to do that.

If the people implementing OKRs focus too much on the practice and not enough on the motivation, I think you just end up with [[CargoCult]]ing. The setting and tracking of KRs becomes the objective.

As one of my coworkers says, the title of the book is "Measure What Matters", but it's too easy to slide into "What Is Measured Is What Matters".

However, note that the process of implementing OKRs has caused the leadership team to write down their expectations, which previously might have been unspoken.

* This is a first step towards resolving the problem.
* The next step is for the CTO to push back, hard, on the bits of these that aren't actually realistic, and hopefully get the leadership team aligned on what can actually be done.

And so, the process of OKRs potentially has value here in flushing out unrealistic or mismatched expectations between different parts of the org.

Shared OKRs are difficult, but sometimes they are unavoidable. The most difficult business problems usually are cross-functional.

At their best, OKRs can help to make these cross-functional dependencies more explicit, and foster communication and collaboration around them.
