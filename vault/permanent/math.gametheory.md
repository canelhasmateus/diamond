The study of [[mathematical]] [[models]] of strategic [[interactions]] between rational agents.


There are fundamental concepts regarding game theory:

A [[game]] consists of
    
A [[set]] of actions for each player
    . May be finite or infite
    . not necessarily simetrical
        
A [[utility function]]
    . For each possible choice of actions
    . the result is usually called utility.

. In some games, the utility that one player wins is the exact utility lost by other players. We call these game "[[Zero-Sum Games]]"


    

A [[Strategy]]
    
. An [[algorithmn]] that receives the data of the current game ( no history ) and outputs an action. 
        
. When the best course is to choose the same action no matter what your oponent does , we call it a * [[dominating strategy]]*. 

. Conversely, when the optimal strategy requires a player to act randomly, according to distributions, we call these *[[mixed strategies]]*. 



Some Observations:
    
    . When there are finite choices, we can analyze then as a [[matrix]]. 

. Finite games and well-behaved continuous ones can be solved by [[linear programming]]

[[Minimax]] Theorem

    . Every two player zero-sum game has a optimal strategy for each player (possibly randomized).
        .. not necessarily the best if your oponent is being dumb , but it maximizes your values without [[special knowledge]] or space to store information about past play. 

    When Both players play a minimax strategy, the expected utility for player 1 is called "value of the game"
        . Its an unique number 
        
        . So what? [[expand]]
