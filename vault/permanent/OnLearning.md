# PracticeLearning

Learning is a very active process and requires [[attention]] to what is being learned.

What makes this very effective is by using some kind of "[[triggers|trigger]]" to evoke the intended reaction.
I found it effective to also have ways of passively learning:

* [[RSS feeds]]
* Reading Lists

.. using my browser 'new tab' to flash me 4 random articles that i put in my read list.
.. Sure! when typing before programming, to enter "[[flow state]]"

Stablishing [[relationships]] is a very good way to remember , [[associate and expand]] ( [[analogies]], for example )
