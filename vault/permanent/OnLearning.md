# OnLearning

Learning is a very active #process and requires #attention to what is being learned.

It is possible to prime yourself - using some kind of #trigger - to evoke the intended reaction when studying.

* [[Akti]]
* Typing and flow.

I find it effective to supplement this with ways to learn more passively:

* [[RSS]] feeds
* Reading Lists

```todo
Establishing #relationships is a very good way to remember , [[associate and expand]] ( [[analogies]], for example )

```
