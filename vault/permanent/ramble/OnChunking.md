# Chunking

When learning to type in a new keyboard #layout configuration,

1. Start by pecking a single key
2. Slowly expand to type more advanced sequences, such as common [[WordBigrams]],
3. Then, entire syllables
4. Finally, Entire words and phrases.

```todo
Are there any parallels to [[prefix trees]] and [[monte-carlo search]]? [[todo]]
```

establishing the #boundaries in which to chunk is a very important and hard #process. Almost an #art.

It may be natural, after some time in the typing process, to start chunking words into syllables. the word `Letting` could be instinctively chunked as "let" and "ting".

However, chunking it into `lett` and `ing` has a far better effect:
Since `ing` is a very common suffix this second chunking is far more #generalizable.

Parallels can be drawn to #software creation and [[SoftwareTesting]]. We start by creating small #implementations - that is, chunks - that #compose into bigger ones.

> The #process of chunking software implementations into testable, reproducible, and #reusable parts, is analogous to finding out the best character chunks for a keyboard layout.
