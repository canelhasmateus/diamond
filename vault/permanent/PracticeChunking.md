[[Chunking]]

. Examples:

When learning to type in a new keyboard layout configuration: we start pecking a single key, then slowly expand to type more advanced sequences, starting with common 'two-letter-patterns', then syllables, then entire words and phrases.

>Are there any parallels to [[prefix trees]] and [[monte-carlo search]]? [[todo]]

Stablishing the [[boundaries]] in which to chunk is a very important and hard process. Almost an art. Expaning on the previous example:

It may be natural, after some time in the typing process, to start chunking words into syllabes. the word "Letting", then , could be instinctively chunked as "let" and "ting".

However, chunking it into "lett" and "ing" has a far better effect:
Since "ing" is a very common suffix in other words, this second chunking is far more [[generalization|generalizible]].

Parallels can be drawn to [[Software]] creation and [[Testing]]. We start by creating small implementations that [[composition|compose]] ( chunk ) into bigger ones.

The process of chunking it into testable , reproducible, and re-usable parts, is analogous to finding out the best "character chunks". [[expand.md | how so? and why?]]
