# ExploitBoundaries

In [[leet 1829]], we leverage the knowledge that the maximum possible value of an #xor operation is a number with only '1' in its #binary representation.

This allows us to *work backward*, avoiding loops to compute k.

Other examples of boundaries are #enumerations: can we work with a reduced or enumerated set of possibilities?
