# ExploitBoundaries

In [[leet 1829]], we leverage the knowledge that the maximum possible value of an [[xor]] operation is a number with only '1' in its [[binary]] representation.

This allows us to *work backwards*, avoiding loops to compute k.

Other examples of boundaries are [[enumerations]]: can we work with a reduced or enumered set of possibilities?
