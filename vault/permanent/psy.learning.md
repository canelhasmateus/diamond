Learning is a very active process, and requires [[attention]] to what is being learned.

However, i found it effective to also have ways of passively learning, by using technologies such as [[RSS feeds]] along with reading lists managers.

. What makes this very effective is by using some kind of "[[triggers|trigger]]" to evoke the intended reaction. In my case, i'm using my browser 'new tab' to flash me 4 random articles that i put in my read list.

. [[expand.md | Are there any other ways i'm using this kind of behaviour?]]
    .. Sure! when typing before programming, to enter "[[flow state]]"

.. Another way i use it is to set up a trigger to 'condense' knowledge: I'm trying to form the following behaviour: Every day, before i start studying, i'll go into yesterday file and "compile" it down.

Stablishing [[relationships]] is a very good way to remember , [[associate and expand]] ( [[analogies]], for example )

[[Chunking]]

. Examples:

When learning to type in a new keyboard layout configuration: we start pecking a single key, then slowly expand to type more advanced sequences, starting with common 'two-letter-patterns', then syllables, then entire words and phrases.

>Are there any parallels to [[prefix trees]] and [[monte-carlo search]]? [[todo]]

Stablishing the [[boundaries]] in which to chunk is a very important and hard process. Almost an art. Expaning on the previous example:

It may be natural, after some time in the typing process, to start chunking words into syllabes. the word "Letting", then , could be instinctively chunked as "let" and "ting".

However, chunking it into "lett" and "ing" has a far better effect:
Since "ing" is a very common suffix in other words, this second chunking is far more [[generalization|generalizible]].

Parallels can be drawn to [[Software]] creation and [[Testing]]. We start by creating small implementations that [[composition|compose]] ( chunk ) into bigger ones.

The process of chunking it into testable , reproducible, and re-usable parts, is analogous to finding out the best "character chunks". [[expand.md | how so? and why?]]

[[Zettelkasten]]
    . Exactly what i'm doing now. Very meta, wow!.
    . Works by making the process of learning very much active and hands on, and focusing more in the [[relationships]] of the things instead of the content itself.

Writing Down
    . Very good to dump your mind.
    . I found it that [[writing]] things downs triggers my mind to not think about them anymore.
    . Must be paired with a way to go over previously annotated content, otherwise it just gets [[forgotten]].
    . I also found it that [[versioning]] things, such as using [[git]], helps writing things down because of the [[confidence]] in which we can change things.
