# Zettelkasten

* Exactly what I'm doing now. Very meta, wow!.
* Works by making the process of #learning very much active and hands-on, and #focusing more on the #relationship of the things instead of the #content itself.

## Writing Down

* Very good to dump your #mind.
* I found it that #writing things downs #triggers my mind to not think about them anymore.
* Must be paired with a way to go over previously annotated content otherwise it just gets #forgotten.
* I also found it that #versioning things, such as using [[Git]], helps writing things down because of the #confidence in which we can #change things.
