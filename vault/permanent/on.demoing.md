# Demoing and Expectation Management

Its frequent, in the process of [[Product Building]] and conceptualization to create demos and mvps. 

Visuals are very helpful in converying meaning and context, and is important to the field of [[ Data Science]] , through [ [ DataViz]].  

We often are tempted to make the demo/graph look as good as possible, out of professionalism and zeal, as there is an obvious force in the visually engaging nature of beaautiful imagery.


However, its important to be transparent when doing so: The appearence of the presentation should reflect the level of polish-ness of the results. 

Its very possible that what is shown is simply not possible. Even if it is, its a fact that  when you building up expectations, you look silly when you aren't [[Psychological Expectations|able to meet them]].


Managing these expectations is good for both you and your peers. 
There is an subtle issue that people inconsciusly calibrate their criticism base on their impression of where you are in the development process, even if you repeatedly remind them that the design is just an early sketch.


A highly polished image that may look like a screen shot of an implemented UI, or at least the result of many weeks' will lead to [[Implicit Assumptions|assumptions]] that only small details can be changed at this point. 

Show them something pretty, and you'll get feedback on font sizes - they never suggesting anything so bold as starting over.


The reviewers make incremental tweaks, blinded by  what is in front of them. By showing them something as crude as a napkin sketch, they don't  see what's there, they see what's possible. You need to implicitly tell reviewers about the kind of feedback you do want at this stage. 

Another point worth mentioning is that people may have difficulty criticizing a design if it seems far beyond what they could have created themselves. 


Is it possible to make web UI's look crude, with the napkin  look and feel?
