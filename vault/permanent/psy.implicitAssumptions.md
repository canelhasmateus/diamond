Implicit assumptions are a common psychological, mathematical and [[psy.phenomena]].

It is the frequent source of [[problems]], since many solutions undisclosely rely in facts which may not be true.

One such examples is to blindly look at averages, without the explicit realization that an average is supposed to be an representative value of an population.

Here, there is the implicit assumption that the average is a representative or meaningful value. This in only true of normal distributions, that is: We're implicitly implying we expected our use case to reflect [[normal distribution]].

[[psy.problemSolving#Question the Premises | Questioning your premises ]] is a frequent remedy for such behaviour.

It is frequently paired with [[Oversimplifications]].
