"
I'm grumbling about my choice of buckets, but in the end, its not the bucket menu, in and of itself that bugs me. I get why you might need to simplify, you can't please everyone.

What bugs me is that software with poorly chosen buckets also tends to be software that - either by intent or carelessness - provides no way whatsoever for its creators to find out if they've got the buckets wrong.
