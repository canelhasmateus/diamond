# IncrementalTheory

Individuals fall somewhere on a spectrum of self-theories. Entity theorists on one and incremental theorists on the other.

Entity theorists tend to view intelligence as innate and fixed, and fundamentally believe that not much can be done to increase intelligence.  

* Fixed mindset.
* more likely to be motivated by appearance than performance
* less likely to collaborate
* hero worship
* [[ImpostorSyndrome]]
* [[CargoCult]]ing

An incremental theorist believes that challenging problems are a core part of the learning process and that intelligence is malleable

* It can be increased through hard work.
* Growth mindset

Individuals can have one theory regarding an area and another when talking about another area: these do not imply global views.

## Moving into the malleable perspective

Bugs present themselves as problems, and because problems tend to be perceived by the entity theorist as fundamental limits on ability, the focus here should be on moving students, peers and co-workers toward a more malleable view of intelligence.

Bugs should not be interpreted as failures of individual programmers.
People should instead be praised for their efforts in practicing the [[DebuggingMindset]] and solving bugs.

In all cases, `solving bugs is part of the learning process`. There are ways of promoting that:

* [[Framing]] of information

  * `I'm sorry for assigning you a task you couldn't learn much from.`
  * praising ability promotes the formation of an entity theory
  * praising effort promotes the formation of an incremental theory

* [[ActiveRecall]]

  * We frequently over-rely on reference manuals
  * Active recall is a study method in which you first guess before looking up the solution
    Flash Cards

* [[SegmentedStudy]]
