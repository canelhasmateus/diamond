For some time now i have this conception of what a "learning" workflow would ideally look like  

Earlier on, i was trying to use other "specialized" apps , such as roam and obsidian, but i kept hitting this barrier of operational friction ;
Had to remap a lot of things, workaround lack of support ; I went to the length of coding an entire plugin to be able to do my shortcuts
(<https://github.com/tgrosinger/leader-hotkeys-obsidian/pull/19>), which was merged yesterday btw.

In summary, this operational friction isn't good, and from my findings, there wouldn't be that much great gains anyway. Any that might exists can be acessed by using the app in a read-only way, while letting the editor do the write-edit heavy part.

With this out of the way, i could focus better on the note-taking content, per se

In regards to note-taking, the approach i've settled down on was a incremental one: Every day i create a single new note , with the date. In this note i just write down streams of thought, with very little structure.
When i "feel like it", i just go over these previous day streams, and pick them apart for the good bits. The connections and structured content comes about in only a second moment : this is something that i would consider key.

For the results, i feel like taking a more structured ( but still organic ) approach to learning makes me more mindful of the process.
Being able to spot those 'gems' that come into our minds, which we know are good content but would not otherwise solidify.
The connection-part thing is very interesting also - Seems like i'm always on the lookout for parallels and analogies now , which i consider a good thing.

All in all , its been pretty good, would def recommend.

The key points should be like:
    1 . Overcome the operational friction by incorporating it inside my editors
    2 . Having triggers for doing it
    3 . Don't stressing about immediately producing structured content.

As an exemplification of the above concepts:
    1 .  I'm using foam / dendron inside vscode , so writing and editing feels way easier
    2 . I developed a web page that gets brought whenever i hit a new tab - This page picks 5 random articles from my readlist and displays them to me.
    3 . Having the daily stream of thought file.

Some great things about having a "simple"  workflow is that:
    .  Easily versionable. This gives me a lot of security , knowing that its always backed up somewhere and i can just undo whatever / whenever.
    . Its flexible: I incorporated my read lists into it ( the lists inside the /other folder. ), and since its text, i can interact with it via custom scripts easily. Currently, i'm able to write down basically every page i visit using autohotkeys, and mark it down as read using python. Also using scripts to create the web page.

For a time now, i've been thinking about what would an ideal learning workflow be:
    . I  would have a structured "Knowledge Sources", such as rss feeds and other read lists
    . I would have some kind of way to process and archive the golden nuggets
    . I would have some kind of way to go over these archives, re-learning them. A big issue i had recently was just forgetting things. Feels like for every two things i learn i forgot about another one.

Up until now i was able to structure only the first one. I feel like zettelkasten has been a good way of implementing the second one. I plan to implement some kind of active-recall or spaced-repetition routines to re-learn what i wrote down.
And i kinda get excited about other possibilites - Can i integrate this with technologies such as GPT3, as to have a *very* personal assistant?
