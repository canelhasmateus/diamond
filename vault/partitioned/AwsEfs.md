Elastic File System

A network file system implementation of POSIX compatible storage. Scales on demand, and provides  Standard and Infrequent storage.

Block Storages are local to each instance, but can be shared.
If high performance is a requirement, use LustreFx.

Only for Linux, but EFX can be used for Windows Based. This happens because Linux and WIndows uses different file sharing protocols ( NFS vs SMB).

For windows, use Linux with Samba Share
