# WritingIsThinking

“Writing is not what follows research, learning, or studying. It is the medium of all this work” - How to Take Smart Notes (Sönke Ahrens)

"Read with the intention to write; What are the open ideas for exploration?"

"Writing is not the outcome of thinking. It **IS** thinking. "
