# ProxyMetrics

It would be incredibly costly if every action was judged in terms of its benefits amortized over your entire lifetime.

Instead, we humans invent pretty arbitrary proxies, such as getting high scores on exams, or in my case, writing shitloads of code.

Proxies are great because they let you make decisions quicker.
