# TipSystemIsNotSource

I have seen less-technical executives repeatedly assume that `the source code of a system == the system`. In other words, they think people are fungible and an architecture can be purchased and transferred *only* by shifting source.

Grab a wad of source and plop it down in front of people who have never worked with it before.

the institutional knowledge that __contextualized__ the system
in the minds of its creators is missing.
