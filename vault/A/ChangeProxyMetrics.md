# ChangeProxyMetrics

[[ProxyMetrics]]

After a few years of doing something very consciously, you build up this great [[RewardSystem]] that makes you feel good about it by itself, but it can take years to retrain.

```mermaid

stateDiagram-v2
 note left of A
 Programming is good because   
end note

    state "I can build this cool game and show it to my friends." as A

    state "I feel good when I do it." as B


 A --> B: Pavlovian Responses
 B --> [*]
    

```

__The problem is when your ultimate goal changes and your old proxies are still in effect.__

When such a thing happens, it is no longer useful to let your habits drive you. It is necessary to put the rational system on the wheel. [[ThinkingFastAndSlow]]
