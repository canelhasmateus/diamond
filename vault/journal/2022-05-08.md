Functional languages are actually quite a bit simpler than many conventional languages. Comparing Haskell to Java, for example, Java has a lot of accidental complexity that Haskell avoids. For example, primitive vs. reference types, instance vs. class methods, type erasure in the implementation of generics, implementation inheritance and its interaction with the four different visibilities, the interaction of coercion, casting, and overloading, and so forth. I’ve also found that surprisingly many students have a hard time wrapping their heads around the impact of mutation of shared (aliased) objects. Functional languages have fewer such complications. That’s not to say that functional languages are easier to learn, but once you know them, they are simpler than many conventional languages.
