what is the plan for today? Better Tdd workflow i guess

 . Colorized and versioned
 . I would like to take some stats too, however. 
 . such as the name of the file being tested,
    the time and number of runs necessary to move a stage, etc



A more structured approach to context switching over the course of the day?
