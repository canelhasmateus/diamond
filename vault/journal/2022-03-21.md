Evernote
        "Import" the remaining posts and books from evernote.
            .. Imported posts, now only books (and urls) remains.

Youtube
        Go through the remaining subscribed youtube channels in my serious account selecting their interesting videos.
            . Put them here

        Once these are all consolidated  do:
            . Remove duplicates
            . Gather "TopLevel" domains make sure i'm following them.
                . Also do a "frequency" by domain
                    "Domain A": "23 posts marked" 
                    ... 

The workflow i'm idealizing is one where i can

#  I I extracted some  out of these, but not everything. Some because there is too much, or whatever other reason

# These are some that came up while navigating through the old ones

# Came Through Youtube
