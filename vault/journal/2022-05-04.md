http 1.1 suffers from HTTP HOL blocking.
http 2 suffers from TCP HOL blocking.

TLS can introduce HOL blocking if used to encrypt larger amounts of data:

* TLS can encrypt up to 16KB of data. This is enough to fill about 11 typical TCP packets.
* Suppose it was done this way. If the first 10 packets get through, but the last one gets lost, we still need to wait for the last one to arrive before pushing it to the browser to process.

There is also an interaction between TCP congestion control and HTTP implementation.
    . The most common way of doing congestion control is : start sending small amount of data ( 14kb ) . If it gets through, double the packet size, until we hit a packet loss. THen, we back down a bit.
    . In http 1.1, each of the 6 connections stablished by the browser will follow this process independently. That means that packet loss in one connection will NOT make another connection have a smaller packet size.
    . In http 2, since all these connections are now multiplexed into a single one, their congestion control become coupled.
    . One example where http 11. 1can lose is on enetworks with limited available bandwitdht: the 6 connections each grow their send rate individually, causing them to overload the network quite quickly, after which they all have to back down and find their co-exitent bandwidth limit through trial and error

    I was recently thinking about the merits of role-based discussions.
not limited to  here - but life in general, althought it seems more geared towards corporate settings
Many meetings / reunions , from my point of view and experience, suffer from a lack of tangibility.
Usually, "Free-Flow" style meetings either are too shallow - requiring other meetings - or too tangential , especially when trying to resolve conflicting point of views.

The idea is that introducing structure may help, e.g: <https://wiki.c2.com/?SixThinkingHats>

TL;DR:

 Set up a sequence of hats, such as blue -- red -- yellow -- black -- white -- green -- red -- blue
 Each hat correspond to a kind of thought, e.g:
  Black == Pessimistic ; White == Optimistic ; Red == Gut Feeling ; Grey == Just Facts ...
 Everyone simultaneously puts on each hat in the sequence and try to produce thoughts of that kind.
 If two contradictory thoughts pop up under the same hat, that's fine: both of them are put down in parallel and the contradiction is resolved later.
 At the end of the sequence you should have a balanced set of information that you can base a decision on.

The  main ideas here are:

 . Encouraging people to disengage themselves from their arguments.
 . It provides a discipline to ensure that the issue under consideration is seen from many sides.
 . Prevents arguments by keeping everybody under the same hat at the same time; resolving these issues is defered to a more appropriate moment in the discussion.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of "Structuring"? Not necessarily this one, but any kind, even tangentially - such as those scrum / restrospective thingies
What are your thoughts about them?

I have seen less technical executives repeatedly assume that the source code of a system == the system. In other words, they think people are fungible and an architecture can be purchased and transferred *only* by shifting source.  

Grab a wad o source and plop it down in front of people who've never worked with it before, the instituional knowledge that __contextualized__ the system
in the minds of its creators is missing.

On algebras

In Vectors space
    An algebra over a field is a vector space equipped with a bilinear vector product

In Logic
    An Relational Algebra in which a set of finitary relations that is closed under certain operators
In Measure THeory
    Algebra over a set, a collection of sets closed under finite unions and complementation
In Category Theory
    An F-Algebra generalizes an algebraic structure
        algebraic streuctures consists of
        . a nonempty set A
        . A collection of operations [ of finite arity, tipically binary ] on A
        . A finite set of identities, known as axioms, that these operations must satisfy.

A functor is a mapping between categories. That is:

    associates each object X in C to an Object F(X) in D,
    Associates each morphism G: X -> Y in C to a morphism F( G ) : F(X) -> F(Y)
        . must preserve identity morphism and composition of morphisms. 

A functor that maps a category to the same category is called a Endofunctor.

A Morphism is a map from one mathematical structure to another one of the same type.

<https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category>:

    A category consists of a collection of things and binary relationships (or transitions) between them, such that these relationships can be combined and include the “identity” relationship “is the same as.”

Quadrature methods:
    Just discretize using a grid lol
        . The construction of sophisticated grids to minimize errors is a core topic of the quase-monte carlo literature
        . The interpolation scheme is also configurable.

    Not great because any attempt to exhaustively quantify a space to estimate expectation values is largely limited to one or two-dimensional problems. In order to scale, we need need to be smarter, and identify exactly where in the ambient space we should be focusing that computation.
        . The answer is obfuscated by the counterintuitive behaviors of high-dimensional spaces:

Welford accumulators?

typical sets
