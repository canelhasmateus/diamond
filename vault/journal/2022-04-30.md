http

    1.0 : one tcp connection for each request
1.1: quickly resolved that ( keep alive time) , but still have only one outstanding request.

websockets
    client sends Get 1.1 upgrade ;
    server return returns with 101 such as switching protocols; a completely different protocol

sse
    client sends ; Get text/event-stream
    server returns ; content = event-stream , transfer-encoding=chunked

        use cases: LIve feed ; SHowing client progress ; Logging 

___

push vs pull

push is stateful

client state information in the server doesnt scale

analise de sobrevivencia

metodologias relacionadas a prever o tempo ate um evento acontecer

    Event  - What you want to predict

    Time - Period taken to see the event

    Censoring - occurs when we don't know the time until the event. 

Survival Function
Hazard Function - The instantaneous potential per unit of time for the event to occur , given that the individual has survived up to time T.

Goals
    Estimate and interpret survivor functions from data
    Compare survivor and or hazard functions
    Assess the relationship of explanatory variables to survival time.

Cox Model
    -> Baseline function  ;
    -> Supposes hazard function has form L( T | X ) = L0*T* exp( phi(x )), where P = x'*B

Concordance Index
    ->  People with higher hazard should take less time until event

Consider using when
    . Tim eis related to the target definition
    . Dealing with censoring
    . Have a small quantity of data
    . Recent data is very important for your problem

Design Of Experiments

___

monads
kliesli arrows
Compositional Application Architecture with reasonably priced monads
Data Types a la carte

most Functional patterns are derived from c ategory theroyd

Free of Interpretation  -> Free Monads
    -> No coupling to framework / runtime
Composable Pieces -> CoProducts
Dependency Injection / IOC -> Implicits & Kleisli
Fault Tolerant -> Dependently tyuped checked exception

Free Monad
    . A monad on a custom algebra that can be run through an interpreter

What is an Application?
    . A collection of algebras and the coproduct resulting from their interaction

The first Algebra

```scala

sealed trait Interact[T]

case class Ask(prompt: String ) extends Interact[String]
case class Tell(msg: String ) extends Interact[Unit]

```

The second Algebra

```scala
 
    sealed trait DataOp[T]

    case class AddContact( a : Contact ) extends DataOp[Unit]
    case class GetAllContacts(  ) extends DataOp[List[Contact]]



```

An application is the CoProduct of its algebras
Coyoneda can give functors for free for our algebras
    "Lift the algebra into the coprpoduct space, so that you can use the coproduct like its composing monads "
