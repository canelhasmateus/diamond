when  shutting linux down, it takes 5 seconds for each drive to shut down, and the current linux bus api is synchronous, which makes linux take a long time to reboot on boxes with many drives.

Http 2 limitation

    
    TCP limitation:
        Head Of Line Blocking
    
    How does a get requests get translated in the network stack?
        . It will be translated as a stream of bytes ( few packets ) in the Client - Server Bidrectional TCP connection 
        . The Server has to acknowledge all the packets, and only then assemble then into a request , IF AND ONLY IF all packets get through.

        . However, if one of the packets doesn't get acknowledged in a certain time, the client retries sending it.

        . When using HTTP2's multiplexing, what happens is that the server cannot differentiate the bytes from different streams when assembling the requests.
            .. If we send 2 requests, and all of the packets for the second one gets acknowledge, but a single packet from the first request doesn't, we cannot proceed with any of the two requests, until the lost packet gets acknowledged.

        . Quic 
            . Userspace design, requires switching between user and kernel contexts
            . serious performance issues when comparing with in kernel protocols, and high jitter under load.
            . network fairness is a problem, and quick can easily throttle down competing tcp sessions. 



http2 pros
    Multiplex
    Compression of both headers and data
    server push
    secure by defauly
    protocol negotiation during tls ( ALPN )
        . Upgrade to http2 happens during tls
http2 cons
    Server push can be abused when configured incorrectly
    can be slower when in mixed mode ( backed is h2 but lb is h1 and vice versa => Can use a L4 lb to circunvent)



we tried to solve the streams with "pipeling", but what the hell is that
