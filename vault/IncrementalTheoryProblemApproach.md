# IncrementalTheoryProblemApproach

A general approach for problem-solving in light of \[\[IncrementalTheory]].

- Develop a general theory of the **problem**
- Ask **questions** leading to a hypothesis
  Very little attention is paid to the formation of a hypothesis, that is,
  Testing without any theory on the cause of the bug. That is a wasted effort.
- Form a **hypothesis**
- Gather and test **data** against the hypothesis
- Repeat
