# IncrementalTheoryProblemApproach

A general approach for problem-solving in light of [[IncrementalTheory]].

* Develop a general theory of the __problem__
* Ask __questions__ leading to a hypothesis
  Very little attention is paid to the formation of a hypothesis, that is,
  Testing without any theory on the cause of the bug. That is a wasted effort.
* Form a __hypothesis__
* Gather and test __data__ against the hypothesis
* Repeat
