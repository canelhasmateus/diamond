* [[OnLeet1020]] can also be implemented differently, by constructing a [[AdjacencyMatrix]] for each of the islands, and exponentiating several times, simulating [[RandomWalks]].
    By doing it enough times to reach any border, we can confidently state that any not-reached island is unreachable. Of course, this approach is not algorithmically efficient.
