## Examples

- \[\[OnLeet1020]] can also be implemented differently, by constructing a \[\[AdjacencyMatrix]] for each of the islands, and exponentiating several times, simulating \[\[RandomWalk]].
  By doing it enough times to reach any border, we can confidently state that any not-reached island is unreachable. Of course, this approach is not algorithmically efficient.
