# BarbellMethod

The Barbell Method is a phrase coined by Nassim Taleb. It means that you make
sure that the majority of your investment is safe while you make small but very
risky bets, combining safety with the possibility of high revenue. The trick is
that you floor the possible loss while leaving the possible revenue unlimited.

In the context of reading, what do loss and revenue means?

1. ⬇️ We invest time and effort.
2. ⬆️ We want to gain useful information. Information is just an opportunity. It means nothing if you don’t use it.

The conclusion:

1. We want to read a lot. We want to have a high influx of information.
2. We want to direct our efforts at the best books (and articles) and invest
only a necessary minimum of attention into the low-quality content.

It is thus, necessary to navigate between multiple brain states and apply them
consciously to the task at hand. [[ExplorationExploitation]]
