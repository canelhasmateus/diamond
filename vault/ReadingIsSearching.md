# ReadingIsSearching

[Reading for the Zettelkasten Is Searching • Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/reading-is-searching/)

Typology of items that serve as an epistemiologic amplifiers ( `elements of information` -> power of clear expectations )

1. Theories: Network of statements that together aim to generate statements about  reality.
2. Models: representations of reality
3. Definitions
4. Argument: Connect a premise to a conclusion
5. Facts - things that are the case or ocurred. At least, there are good reasons to accept that.

`Now we have a small ontology of item types that are hidden in the various texts we read. If you read a text for your Zettelkasten you should search for items. This will deepen your knowledge work with the text and accelerate the reading process.
`

` introduce the 6 items Sascha lists here as a starting point to define & recognize elements of information in the student’s sources. At first they don’t think much of this, but soon recognize the power of having clear expectations: they can listen more selectively during class and improve the quality of their notes, and read selectively and thus speed up their research.`
