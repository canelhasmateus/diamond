# TimeManagementIsntTheProblem

Focus and Attention management >>> Time Management

> [[TimeManagement]], [[Scheduling]]

Time Management is reached for because people recognize the issue:
`They find it difficult to get things done throughout the day`
They *feel* a lack of time.  What we truly feel is not lack of time, is lack of
result or a lack of ability to do some activity.

"If you had infinite time, would that solve the problem?"

> [[AbsurdQuestions]]

Unintively, no, because during that time we would end up scheduling and wanting
to do more things.  If a day was one hour only, We would not even TRY to do the same amount of
things we do.

Tasks is not what should be managed, instead it should be attention, energy and focus.
