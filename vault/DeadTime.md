# DeadTime

A span of time spent doing an activity where the focus and attention
isn't directed towards something specifically, and can be freed up.

e.g : Commuting -> Podcasting while doing so.

> [[TimeManagement]]

What you're doing with your time is sometimes fixed.
But what you do with you focus and attention is up to your discretion.

There is a lot of time wasted between activities here and there.
In between tasks, for example.

`Your objective is not to fill the time, your objective is to "get things done"`.
