# 2023-1-weekly.md

Getting back at zettelkasteing this week.
Getting back is hard. Need to peel at open threads to get back into form.

* Goal:
    Induce Structure over this repository:
    Not only *have* structure, but have *strict* definitions of what is what.
  * Tags
  * Folders
  * Contents

What is `C`?

* C is mess. It is a collection of notes divided in *coarse grained topics*.
Usually, information aggregates here, until the some subset of the aggregation has enough *mass* or *cohesion* to warrant the creation of a `specific note` in folder `B` or `A`.

* B is also a mess. It is a collection of notes divided in *fine grained topics*.
Usually, topics sit here, until it is worked into a note *polished enough* to warrant move to folder `A`.
