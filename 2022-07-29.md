here are no such commands as dd, yy, or cc. For example, dd is not a separate command for deleting the line, but a d command with a d motion.
Wait, but there isn't a d motion in Vim! That’s right, and that’s why Vim has a dedicated set of commands for which it checks whether the command equals to motion and if so, it executes _motion instead.
_ is an interesting motion that isn't even documented in vi, and it refers to the current line. So, commands like dd, yy, and similar ones are simply translated to d_, y_, etc. Here is the source of this knowledge.

You can use g- or g+ to go between text-states. To go to a text state 1 minute earlier, you can use:

Vim has some special marks which it sets automatically. Here are some of the most useful:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `` `. `` | jump to position where last change occurred in current buffer |
| `` `" `` | jump to position where last exited current buffer |
| `` `0 `` | jump to position in last file edited (when exited Vim) |
| `` `1 `` | like `` `0 `` but the previous file (also `` `2 `` etc) |
| `''` | jump back (to line in current buffer where jumped from) |
| ` `` ` | jump back (to position in current buffer where jumped from) |
| `` `[ `` or `` `] `` | jump to beginning/end of previously changed or yanked text |
| `` `< `` or `` `> `` | jump to beginning/end of last visual selection |
