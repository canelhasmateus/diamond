# Summary  

Economic value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an agent.

It is generally measured through units of currency.

The interpretation is, therefore:

> what is the maximum amount of money a specific actor is willing and able to pay for the good or service?

Said another way, value is how much a desired object or condition is worth relative to other objects or conditions.

Economic values are expressed as "how much" of one desirable condition or commodity will, or would be given up in exchange for some other desired condition or commodity.

First, economists tried to estimate the value of a good to an individual alone, and extend that definition to goods that can be exchanged. From this analysis came the concepts [[value in use]] and [[value in exchange]].

When an economist observes an [[exchange]], two important value functions are revealed: those of the [[buyer]] and [[seller]].

Just as the buyer reveals what he is willing to pay for a certain amount of a good, so too does the seller reveal what it costs him to give up the good.
