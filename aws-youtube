Aws Cloud
    REgions
        . Very Large Geographical Area
        . Many Datacenters, called an Availability Zone
        AZ
        Local Zones:
            Not all applications can tolerate latency. Thats what Local Zones are for.
            Inside a region, they extend the region to your geographic metro-area network 
            ( Opt-in to a local zone. Inside it you can create your vpc and resources )
        Edge Locations

    


Local Zone
    . Enable Local Zone
    . Extend your VPC to the local zone
    . Build and Run Low-Latency applications

    . Use for edge computing

Edge Locations
    . Access cloudfront


"
A local zone is where you place your computers ( designed for computing ).
A Edge Locations is where you access your CDN.
"




VPC
    . A Virtualized Datacenter.



Types of CLoud ARch
    Private CLoud
        . Running Independently
        . OpenStack Ansible 
        .. You have the benefits of the cloud inside your own data center
        .. You gotta manage your own cloud

    Hybrid Cloud
        . Data Center + cloud
        . Ideal for migratoin
        . great for permance
        . good for Disaster Recovery
        ..  Data Center > AWS Direct Connect > Customer VPC Gateway > Cloud VPC.
    
    Pure Cloud
        . Great for startups
        . Highly scalable
        . Very agile
        .. Organization > AWS Direct Connect > Customer VPC  > VPC
    Public CLoud
    
Why extend private cloud to the public?
    . Our data center cannot handle peak loads such as christmas
    . Offload some of those things
    . Then you have a hybrid cloud.

Public cloud:
    . Everything inside a provider ( GCP , AWS , Azure  , ... )


OSI Model
    Every Network provider uses the same system, which helps troubleshooting.

    Layers
        1 - Physical Layer ( Electrons / Photons over copper / Optical ) - Bits 
        2 - Datalink ( Hardware : Network cards , Addresses ) - Frames
        3 - Network  ( Logical Address : Ip Address ) - Packets
        4 - Transport ( Protocol Selectrion : TCP , UDP) - Segments 
        ## Networking ends here 
        5 - Session ( Controls Connection : Sockets ) - Data
        6 - Presentation ( Presentation and Data : TLS ) - Data 
        7 - Application ( User Interface : HTTP , DNS , SSH ) - Data
    
    Ip Address:
        Needed for every device that wants to communicate in an network.

        IPV4 / IPV6 : Mostly PCs vs Mostly Mobiles
            . IPV4  have very few addresses. Which is why private ip addresses were created. 
            They occur at the 10.0.0/8 ;  140~172.0.0.0/16; 192.168.0.0/16 
                > Not Routable. Can use internally but not externally
        We used to have a idea of these Class address.
            A: Each subnet would handle 16M.
            B: 65k hosts
            C: 253 hosts
            D: Multicast reserved
            
Subnetting:
    Breaking down networks into smaller ones or group smaller network
    CIDR: We can't make inefficient use of ip addresses because they're few.
    AWS only have 100 routes.
AWS takes 5 addresses for each subnet ( instead of 2 that every else would do.)
    . You might run out of ip addresses when designing small networks when using autoscaling

    
What if we wanted  to create greater subnets (aggregating small ones) ? 
    This is called supernetting
    Can be used to do network summarization
        Good to create smaller routes
    

IPV4: 32bit.
IPV6: 128bit  -> All interfaces in AWS are automatically assigned an ipv6 global address.



Connectivity
    Over the Internet with a VPN
        Providing a private network over  a public network
        Why
            Internet is not secure.
                . You'll get hacked
            Take care of routing
                . 
            Internet routing is *very* complex
                . 
            Can't take Private ip addresses and connect them via public internet . They are non-routable.
        Why not?
            VPN's depend on the internet.
                Internet is not consistent ( Best Effort Connectivity).
        Tools
            . Frame Relay
            . GRE Tunnels
            . BGP
            * IPSEc
                . Encrypts the data
                . Provides authentication of users on both sides.
                    .. Ok to give critical information to authorized people.
                . Ensure messages have not been modified ( Message Integrity ).
                . Non-Repitiation ( Senders can't say they didn't send the message )
                . So valuable that you can use them in public connections.
            Logical
                Data Center > VPN ( IPSEC ) > Cloud
        
    Pseudo-Wire to the cloud
        

WHen you set a vpn between your data center and your vpc, its usually a site-to-site vpn.
There also exists a Multi-Site VPN.
    Both sites terminate the vpn connection

    Can use Dynamic or Static routing.

AWS says their vpns are Highly Available.
    They're using a virtual router with somewhat redundancy.
        . If the router in YOUR end fails, everything fails.
        . Still a single point of failure
        Recommended by AWS:
            Set up one active and one passive.
    
    When using Multiple Links:
        You must always have at least 2. And 3 is better than 2.
        You can Load Share.
            What if we decide to do it?
                use BGP tunning.
                    Set a most specific route in one, and a most specific and other, send a summary route to both.

        
    

    Not good enough.
    



VPN in cloud 
    Determine the aws virtugla Gateway
    Take your method   ( Static / BGP )
    Choose your tunnels ( default or custom )
    VPN Concentrator via market place

Remote Access VPN
    Market Placefssqq
    

What if We use a Multi-Site  vpn connection?
    AWS assumes you do not have the knowledge to control transitive networks
    You can link everyone with everyone else ( Very Inelegant, O[ N * ( N - 1 ) ] )
    Need to use another solution: Cloud Hub.



Internet is not a given
    . Use Direct Connection ( Garanteed bandwitdh )
    . Options ( 1gbps , 10gpbs, 100gbps )

    . Can Also do Link Aggregation
        . Take Multiple Links in a bundle, so they feel like a single link.
        . Take 4 10gbps and have a 40gbps.
