Microservices benefits
    Tech Heterogeneity -> Pick the right tool for the job
Resilience
    . In case of problems, its possible to isolate and degrade functionality instead of totasl failure

Other decompositional techniques
    
    Shared LIbraries
    Modules ( ? ... )

"Recruiting is a problem ... with this observation bias where you only see how well the people you hire are doing."

The yoneda philosophy []
 
Things are defined by their relationships with other things.
"An generalization of cayley's theorem "
    Every Group is isomorphic to a permutation group

Each row and column contains all group elements -> Its a Latin Square

"Symmetry as a compression tool"

"Numbers measure size,  groups measure simmetry"




"Hormorphism is a map F from S -> T such that for all x, y \e S, 
        F( X )*F( Y ) = F( X * Y )

set associative caches


current arch caches are set-associative
    . Broken into sets, and each set contains a specified number of elemnets , the so called associativity
    . Each element is called a cache line or a cache block 
    . the cpu always communicates with ram and its caches in cache lines. 
    . currently, 64bytes 
    . Start of cache lines: 0x00 0x40 0x80 0xc0

The CPU uses a "Tagged Pointer" approach to find the cache and the offset. 
    . For example, in a 64 bits address, use the first 8 to encode the set, the next 8 to encode the tag.

When evicting, each cpu executes its Policy Eviction, which varies but is usually LRU.
