testing without mocks

mocks are a way to isolate code from its dependencies
    . Why not use?

    . They're solitary tests - you end up with gaps between the units: they may function alone, but not together.
    . Integration tests are supposed to deal with the gaps, but they are slow and duplicate effort. 


Overlapping Sociable Tests
    . 
Nullable Infrastructure
    . Eventually we hit part of the code that we don't want to run.
    . Nullable Infrastructure is real production code that can be disable
    . Tracks state when needed
    . Implemented with embedded stubs

DA impact

Data Modeling
    . Less chaos and more 'central' datasets that decouple backend architecture from BA/DS/MLE
Data CLarity
    . Source of Truth
    . Documentation
Tackling the data gap
    . Through DA squads have support to solve their data challenge
