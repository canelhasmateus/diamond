# The debugging mindset


A uhge amount of time is spent validating and debugging software

Hyperfocus on elimination of bugs during development is counterproductive, programmers should embrace debugging as an exercise in problem solving




"Buygs occuer as a result of 'chains of cognitive breakkdown .... formed over the course of programming activity'"



 At a fundamental leve, all software describes changes in the state of a ssystem over time. because the number of staes and transition can be combinatorial complexity, programmers necessarily rely on approximations of system behavior ( mental models ) durin g development. T%He intet of a metnal model is to allow programmers to reason accurately about the behaviour of a system 

    . They're approximations, and sometimes incorrect

    . Neophyte programmers experience this problem to a greater degree: their models of the language and development environment are necesarily incomplete, and aeven simple systax error can be major blocker for someone learning to program. 

    
The most sinister bugs occur when programmers falsely blieve their mental models to be ocomplete. 


THe most effective atdebugging draw from extensive experience, as well as refined problem-solving ksill. They also employ generalized strategies for problem solving, instead of treating every individual bug as a new, specific case. 

Experience and accurate models are precisely trhe tools that novice programmers lack. Debugging is not taught as a specific course in universites. Individuals must be cognizant of how to approach proble,s, and wheter they are perceived as limits of ability or as part of the learning process. 


Vm, interpreted and languages with runtime environmen tsencourage users to view the executiron environment as a black box
 The goal here is to make programming easire by reducing the scope of the mental model the progrmmmaer ust maintain. When bugs occur in these execution environments ,you're left with a complete gap in understanding. You might solve this vby understaingg more about the execution environment,,ts but then, what is the point of that abstraction?such runtime environemnts are not a panacea, you still need to understad how they behave
 


Indiviiduals fall somewhere on a spectrum of self theories. 
    . Entity theorist on one end to the incremental theroist on the toher. 

Entity theoriest tends to view intelligence as innate and fixed, and fundamnetally believes that not much can be done to increase intelligence.  => Fixed mindset 
    . more likely to be motivated by appearance than performance
    . less likely to collaborate
    . hero worship, impostor syndrome, cargo culting
    
An incremental theorist believes that challenging problems are a core party of the learning process and that intelligence is malleable: it cna be increase through hard workd.  => growth mindset

Individuals can have one theory in reegardxs to a area and another when talking about another area: these do not imply global viesws. 


bugs present themselves as problems, and brecause problems tend to be perceived by the entity theorist as fundamental limits on ability, the focus here should be on moving students, peers and co-workers gtorward a more malleable view of intelligence. 

Bugs should not be interpreted as failures of individual programmers. 
People should instead be praised for their efforts in solving bugs. In all cases, solving bugs is part of the learning process. 

How to move people from the fixed to the malleable perspective?
    . It can be done sometime by the framing of information 
        .. praising ability promotes formation of an entity theory
        .. praising effort promotes formation of an incremental theory
    
    "I'm sorry for assigning you a task you couldn't learn much from"


Active Recall 
    . Over reliance on reference manuals and documentation 
    . Active reacall is a study method in which you first make a guess before looking up the solution => Flash Cards

Segmented study
    . Our brains are not tuned to focus on specific tasks for hours on end
    . Segmented study is the idea of gaving one or two additional and unrelated task to switch to over the course of an acitivity
    . Switching gesrs and taking breaks are effective methods for making progress when you're stuck

A general Approach
    . Develop a general theory of the problem
    . Ask questions leading to a hypothesis
    . Form a hypothesis
    . Gather and test data gainst the hypothesis
    . Repeat

Very little attention is paid to the formation of a hypothesis, resulting in a wasted effort:
    . Testing without any theory pertaining to the cause of the bug.

Complexity lies aty the root of our problems withy software systems. 

Separating the essential complexity from any accidental complexity is a better way of building software

How do we try to understand systems? 
    . Can go somewhere by outside-in ( blackbox ) approach, but it has limits
    . Informal Reasoning
        .. case-by0base mentalk simulation of behaviour.
        .. Greatly hampered by state
        .. As the number of states, and hence the number of possible scenarios that must be considered grows,  the effectiveness of informal reasoining buckles. 
        .. For every bit of state that we add, we double the total number of possible styates
    
Stateful procedures contaminate everything it touches. 


After state, control logic is the biggest source of complexity. 
    . When a programmer is forced, ( through use of a language with implicit control flow ) to specify the congtrol, he or she is being forced to specigfy an aspect of how the system syhould work rather than simply what is desired. 
    . Like basic control such as branching, but as oppsosied to sequencing, concurrency is normally specxified explicitly in most langues. the most common moderl is the shared state concurrency, in which specification for explicit synchronization is required. the impacts that this has for informal reasoning asre well knwon , and the dificulty comes from adding further to the number of scenarios that must mentally be considered as the program is read. 

Complexity breeds complexity
    . Duplication is a prime example. If ( due to state, control or code volume ) its not clear that the functionality already exists, or it is too complex to understand wherer what exists does exactly what is required, there will be a strong tendendcy to duplicate, particularly true in the presence of time pressures
    . The more that is possible within the language, the harder it is to understand systems constructed in ti. 

OOP is inherently stateful , because it relies on state ( and identity ) contained within objects. 

Essential complexity is inherent , and the essence of the problem ( as seen by the users ) 

Accidental complexity is all the rest - complexity with which the development team would not have to deal with in the ieal world 
    . performance issues
    . suboptimal language 
    . infrastructure

sometimes, accidental satete is required:
    . Performance, for efficiency
    . Ease of expressions - accidental state can be the most natural way to express logic in some casese. 

We should create syshtems that are aware of these concepts: They should allow for the accidental but useful complexity, but encapsulate it completely away".


"The system should still function completely correctly if the "accidental but useful" bits are removed, albeit possibly unnaceptably slow. "

They call this Functional Relational Programming


"Feeders components converts inputs into relational assignments - cause changes to the essential state. 
Observer components generate output in response to changes which they observe."

good ops starts in design and development
    . 80% of operation issues originate in design an development
    . When systemss fail, there is a natural tendency to look first to operations isince that is where the porblem actually took plance


Three tenets

    Expect failures
    Keep things simple
        . complexcity breeds problems, simplet things are easier to get right
    Automate everything
        . people make mistages, sleep and forget things
        . Automated processes are testablle, fixable, therefore ultimately much more reliable. 
    

Very unusual combinations of failures maye be determined sufficiently unlikely that ensureing the system can operate through them is uneconomical. Be cautious when making this judgement. We've been surtprised at how frequently unusual combinations of events take plance when running thousands of servers that produce millions of opportunities for component failures each day. 

Recognize that multiple versions willl be live during rollout and production tresting
    . Versions n and n + 1 of all comoponents need to coexist peacefully. 

Partition the system in such a way that partitions are infinitely adjustable and fine-gfained and not bnounded by any real worlds entity ( person, collection, customer )
    . If the partition is by company, then a big company will exceed the size of a singler partition. 
    . If the partition is by name prefix, then eventaully all the P's, for example, won't fit on a single server. 

Designing for automoation may involve significant service-model constraints
    . Automating administration of a service after design and deployment can be very difficult. 
    Secussful automation requires simplicity and clear , easy-to-make operational decisions. 
    This in turns depends on a careful service design that, when necessary, sacrifices some lastency and trhoughput to ease automation. The trade off is often difficult to make, but the administrative savings can be more than an order of magnitude in high scale services. 
    . Example: choosing synchornous replication in order to simplify the decision to failover, avoiding the complications of asynchronous replication. 

Keep configuration and code as a unit throughout the lifecycle. 

The most appropriate level to handle failures is the service level 
    . Its where the full context is available.
    . Build redundancy into the service rather than dependending upon recovery at tge lower software layter. 

Careful with depdencies. 
    . Depdendecy management in high-scale services often doesn't get the attention the topic deserves. As a general rulew, dependence on small components or services doesn't save enough to justify the complexity of managing thme. 
    
    Dependencies do make sense when: 
        . Components being dependende upon are substantion in size or compolexity, 
        . The service being depended upon gains its value in being a single, central instance

    If introducing dependencies:
        . Expect latency
        . Isolate failures
        . Use proven components
        . Implement inter-service montingn and alerting
        . Decouple components so that operation can continue in degraded mode if a dependency fails 
    Dependent services and produces of dependent components need to be commited to at least the same sla as the dependening service. 

Don't bother trying to create full stagin environments as close as possible to production. 
    . Cost goes assyumptoic and rapidly approaches that of prod. 
    . Take new service releases through standard unit, functional, and production test lab testing and then into limited production as the final test phase ( canary )


    The production system must have sufficient redundancy to be able to quickly recover from a catastrophic failure

    Data corruption or state-related failures have to be extremely unlikekly

    Errors must be detected and the engieering team must be monitoring system health of the code in test, and 

    it must be possible to quickly roll back all changes and this roll back must be tested before going into production. 

    "A potentially counter-intuitive approach is deployment mid day. 
    At night, there is greater risk of mistakes. If anomalies crop up when deploying in the middle of the night, there are frewer engineers around to deal witht hem. "

Use production data to find problems
    Quality assurance in large-scale system is a data mining and visualization problem, not a testing problem. Everyone needs to focus on getting the most out ofo the volumes of data in a production environment. 

Make the development team responsible
    . If the development team is frequently called in the middle of the night, automation is the ikely outcome. If operations is frequently called, the usual reaction is to grow the operations team. 

Instrumenteverything , datta is the most valuable asset. 
It is vital that each service have a fine grained knob to slowly ramp up usage when coming back online or recovering from a catastrophic failure.

Functors, applicatives and monads

Functors:
    Values wrapped in contexts
    Have an fMap to apply a function to the boxed value
Applicatives
    What if the Function is wrapped in a context?
Monads
    Functors apply a functoin to a wrapped value.
    Applicatives apply a wrapped function to a wrapped value
    Monads apply a function that returns a wrapped value to a wrapped value

TRhe expression problem a new name for an old problem. 
The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the datatype and new functions over the datatype, without recompiling existing code, and while retaining static type safety. 


"Once can think of cases as trows and functions as columns in a table. 
In a functional language, the rows are fixed ( cases in a datatype declaration ), but it is easy to add new columns ( functions ). 
In a object oriented language, the columns are fixed ( methods in a class declaration ) but it is easy to add new rows ( subclasses ). 
We want to make it simple to add either rows or columns. 
"

]~> Do parametric types beats virtual types? 
    . wtf does this even mean. 

Object Algebras to the rescue.
