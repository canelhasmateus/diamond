Ip defines Five Addresses Classes:
    

    A, B, C Consist of unicast IP Addressesd
        

    D are multicast addresses
    E are experimental or for future use

    Their ranges are:
        A 1-126
        B 128-191
        C 192-223
        D 224-239
        E 240-255


    Only 126 class A network exists, and 161777214 possible hosts in each of them.
    16384 class B network exists and 65534 hosts in each of them
    More than 2 million class C network exist, with a maximum of 254 hosts in each of them



Regional INternet Registries are the organizations responsible for the allocation of address spaec within specific geographical areas
    ( LACNIC ) for Latin America

    Local Internet Registries ( LIR ) or Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) are allocated blocks of IPv4 Addresses
    They assign space to their customer for exclusive use in their networks
    Businesses use these blocks to create subnetworks and assign IP addresses to devices.

BGP
    Protocol that makes the internet works
    The internet is a network of networks which is broken up into hundreds of thousands of smaller networks known as autonomous systems ( AS )
    Essentially a large pool of routers run by a single organization
    Autonomous systems typically belong to ISP or other large high-tech organizations: Tech companies, universities, government agencies and scientific institutions
    Each AS wishing to exchange routing information must have a registered autonomous sytem number ( ASN )
    IANA assigns asn to RIR's
    RIR's assign them to ISP and network
    ASN's are 16 bit numbers between 1 and 65534 and 32 bit numbers between 131072 and 4294967294
    As of 2018, there are approx 64000 asn in use worldwide
    ASNs are like "IP addresses" - assign them to routers


Scenarios of Multi-Homing
    Single Link - Multiple Ip Addresses
    Multiple Interfaces - An Ip Address per interface
    Multiple Links - An Ip Andress
    Multiple Links - Multiple Ip Addresses

    allows Multi-Homing:

        BGP 
        SCTP 

Private Addressing
    CIDR - is a global address assignment convention that defines how ip addresses should be assigned relevant agencies
        These include the IANA, its member agencies and ISP
        Defines a way to assign public ip addresses, worldwide, to allow route aggregation or route summarization
        Allows RIR's and ISP's to reduce waste by assigning  a subset of a classful network to a single customer, eg.


            ISPs customer A needs only 10 ip addresses and Customer B needs 25 ip addresses
                . Assign Customer A CIDR block 198.8.3.16/28 - This has 14 assignable addresses , 198.8.3.17 to 198.3.30
                . Assign customer B CIDR block 198.3.32/27 - This has 30 assignable addresses, 198.8.33 to 198.8.3.62


    Local networks that never connect to the internet can assign any IP address to a device
        An organized method of doing this is to use private reserved addresses
        Defined in RFC 1918
        This TFC defines a set of networks that will never be assigned to any organization as a registered network number

        Class A ; 10.0.0.0 ; 1 network
        Class B; 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.0.0 ; 16 networks
        Class C; 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.0; 256 networks

        We can combine these with CIDR block to split each network into subnetworks

    Hosts within enterprises that use IP can be categorized into:

        Do not require access to hosts in other enterprises or the internet
        Hosts that need access to a limited set of outside services ( email, ftp, remote login )
        Hosts that need network layer access outside the enterprise

    Moving a host from private to public or vice versa involves a change of IP address, DNS, Hosts, etc
        May reduce an enterprise flexibility to access the Internet
        May require renumbering when merging several private internets

    Private network within enterprises for security reasons

    Rules:
        Private addresses have no global meaning
        Routing information about private networks shall not be propagated on inter-enterprise links
        Indirect references to such addresses should be contained within the enterprise


    Route Aggregation

        Routers need to know the destiantion of every packet they encounter
        If no info in the routing table, they use a default route
        The mega hubs / routers for the internet can't have default routes
            A typical no-default router have around 750k routes / entries in the table

        Using Prefix/suffix mask allows for a hierarchical design
        aggregation helps reduce size and complexity of routing tables
        a router can pass on the aggregated routes

DHCP

    Ip address assignment can be static or dynamic for devices
    Static involves manually specifying the IP addresses
    Dynamic involves specifying a pool of addresses on the router so a new computer get one allocated automatically


    Four-way Handshake:
        1 . A client automatically sends out a special DHCP discover message using the broadcast address
        2 . Server sends the DHCP client a DHCP Offer message
        3 . Client sends out a DHCP Request ( Accepting the offer )
        4 . Server then sends a DHCP Ack


Unicast
BroadCast
    Receivers validate if they're intended receivers

MultiCast 
    Ip class D




Ipv6
    
    Ipv4 only has 32vit -> 4 billion addresses ( not enough )
    Extends 32bit ip address to 128 bits, allowing up to 2^128
