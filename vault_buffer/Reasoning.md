# Reasoning

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGunohFHbK0>

theory discover as program synthesis

some synthesis are hard becauuse of lack of invertibility

* need injection and surjection

we can create parametric inversions to work around that fact, though.

> many modes of reasonin can be though as program transformation
