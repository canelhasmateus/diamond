## Proxy Metrics

<https://erikbern.com/2015/06/05/the-hardest-challenge-about-becoming-a-manager.html>
I think what happens in your brain is you create all these proxies for accomplishments that take years to retrain. I would be incredibly costly if every action was judged in terms of its benefits amortized over your entire life time. Instead, we humans have an ability to invent pretty arbitrary proxies, such as getting high scores on exams, or in my case, write shitloads of code.

Proxies are great because they let you make decisions much quicker.

After a few years of doing something very consciously (programming is good because I can build this cool game and show it to my friends) you build up this great rewards system (kind of like Pavlov's dogs?) that makes you feel good about it in itself (programming is cool because I feel good when I do it).

The problem is when your ultimate goal changes and your old proxies are still in effect.

## Meaning

    On Sucess:
        Atlas struggle becomes everyday more real.
        Our real goal and fulfilment doesn't come from reach the summit, but from the pain of rolling the ball. Thus, suffering / struggle not only is necessary to reach our potential, it is the actual goal.

The crisis of meaning (  Jung )
    . The general neurosis of our times
    . The lack of meaning is a soul-sickness whose full extent and import out age has not yet began to comprehend

 Viktor Frankl
    . Ever more people have the means to live, but no meaning to live for

happiness is about the present moment, independentof other moments, whereas meaning links events across time, thus integrating past, present, and future ( IAIN McGilchrist)

How can we discover a meaningful life message
    . tap into the wisdom  of the old mythos
    . what is the use of a religion withtout a mythos, since religion means, if anything at all, precisely that function which linkws us bgack to the eternal myth?

    . contains truthes about the human predicament and the nature of psyche expressed in narrative form. 

    both logos and mythos are realms to discovering truthts, but their truths are of a different nature
        . logos teaches us how to cure a sickness
        . mythos teaches us how to cope with loss and death

Is not jesus a prototype of those who, trusting their inner experience, have gone their individual ways in defiance of the world?

____

Myth of arrival:
    . The myth that we're going to a point of permanence, somehow.

The mere participation in the activities becomes the reward itself.

it is the best approach for reaching the ideal situation whereby we can support ourselves by means of activities we find intrinsically rewarding. :
Many people dream of such a line, but few attain it due to the sole reason most people don't get very good at what they do.

Struggle free life:
    . Not a life the human organism is suited for
    . We're restless creatures - tied by mortal nature - and cannot be tamed by external success
    . Our restless can only be tamed through the continual exertion of effort towards ends we deem worthy.

"We measure ourselves by many standards [ ... ] But deeper than all such things, and able to suffice unto itself without them, is the sense of the amount of effort we can put forth. He who can make none is but a shadow; He who can make much is a hero.

## Anxiety

"
If we wish to escape from a life of passivity, stagnation and mediocrity, we must be willing to attend the 'School of Anxiety' - Has a demonic side that can ruin or life, but also a side that can guide us towards the development of a greater self.
    - Which one shows, depends on a large degree to how we approach the anxiety inducing situation of our life.
  
"

Unlike other creatures, who are ruled by instinct and necessity, we must "contend with our freedom."
    . Choosing among the possible paths, and taking the steps towards actualizing these possibilities leads to self creation - the ultimate task of man.
    .  "Man is a creature who is continually beckoned by possibility, who conceives of possibility, visualizes it, and by creative activity carries it into actuality. "

The trouble is choosing the path.
    . Possibility means "I can" - In a logical system it is convenient enough to say that possibility passes over into actuality. In reality is is not so easy, and an intermediate determinant is necessary. This intermediate determinant is anxiety.
    . Every step is patterned the same.
        .. Envision possibility that could further our self creation
        .. Experience the anxiety that accompanies the process of moving forward into a unpredictable and open ended future, but move forward regardless.

The capacity to bear anxiety is important for the individuals self realization and for his conquest of his environment. Every person experiences continual shocks and threats to his existence, indeed, self-actualization occur only at the price of moving ahead despite such chocks. This indicates the constructive use of anxiety.

"
In refusing to move towards the possibility that makes us anxious, we have made a faustian bargain. We gain some temp comfort in avoiding the challenge and remove the chance for failure.
"

"
Those who refuse to launch at into life must commit partial suicide - We must kill off the side of ourselves that desires self-actualization

"
No one is coming ;
to save me ; to make life right for me ; to solve my problems ;
the dream of a rescuer who delivers us leaves us passive and powerless.

"
One of the most important therapeutically effective factors if subjecting yourself to the objective judgement of others
"

"
Often those afflicted by anxiety , believe that if they can avoid the things that trigger their symptoms, then a relatively comfortable life is still possible - symptom management, rather than recovery becomes their primary goal.
"

"
Flight from life does not exempt us from the law of age and death. He who tries to wriggle out of the necessity of living winds nothing and only burdens himself with a constant foretaste of aging and dying, which must appear especially cruel on account of the total emptiness and meaningless of his life
"

"
What direction the patient's life should take in the future is not ours to judge; It is better to renounce any attempt to give direction and simply to try to throw into relief everything that the analysis brings to light , so that the patient can see it clearly and be able to draw suitable conclusions.

Anything he has not acquired himself he will not believe in the long run, and what he takes over from authority merely keeps him infantile. He should rather be put in the position to take his own life in hand.
"

"
There are many neurotics whose inner decency prevents them from being at one with present-day mo reality and who cannot adapt themselves so long as the moral code has gaps in it which is of the crying need of our age to fill.

They aren't ill because they haven't found a way to live live everyone else ; but because they have not yet found a new form for their finest aspirations ;
Some are born and destined to be bearers of new cultural ideals ; they are neurotic as long as they bow down before authority and refuse the freedom to which they are destined
"

Not everyone is in this category, however .

## Acceptance

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIoJhqnOc0M>
"
The shadow,m when it is realized, is he source of renewal ; when there is an impasse, and sterile time in our lives, despite an adequate ego development - we must look to the dark, hitherto unacceptable side which has been at our conscious disposal
"

"
awaken to the troubling idea that our portion of or personality is add odds with current morality and  with our family , peers and society judge as good and evil
"

"

Examine the morality we have been grow into;
its not that we must turn evil in the sense of turning criminal ; but in the sense of detaching ourselves from the flaws of our moral code so we can reconnect with the parts of our personality we lost to our shadow long ago.

This is not only normal, but essential; The achievement of independence involves the capacity of the ego not only to adopt the values of the collective but also to secure the fulfillment of those needs of the individual which run counter to collective values - and this entails doing evil.

By not being aware of having a shadow, you declare a part of your personality to be non-existent. If you get rid of qualities you don't like by denying them, you become more and more unaware of what you are, declaring yourself more and more non-existing and your devils will grow fatter and fatter.

First, one has to accept and take seriously the existence of the shadow. Second, one has to become aware of its qualities and intentions . This happens through conscientious attention to moods, fantasies and impulses. Third, a long process of negotiation is unavoidable
"

"
Do we experience a simmering anger for no apparent reason ?
Maybe we have recurrent fantasies, born from resentment, bitterness, self-hate ; Desire for destruction and revenge ;
In these cases, it is likely that we have not integrated our aggression into our conscientious personality;
to initiate such process, we can seek safe, controlled and productive outlets within we can act with more aggresion ( sport, martial arts , more assertive of our behaviours, inclined to stand our ground)

Most indivividuals, fearing the complex depths within, remain at the superficial and surfacer layer of their psyche ; industriouly mindful of their common comedy and not at of themselves

"What he wanted was totality ; he disciplined himself to wholeness, he created himelf. ~~ about Goethe"

"
the beast within
just as a raging river can be harnessed for its energy, so can the uncivilized layers of the psyche, if handled and channeled properly, can revitalize life.
"

"The mind as multiplicity - an aggregation of intertwined psychological entities

the most general picture of our essence is an association of drives ,with constant rivalry and particular alliances with each other.
"
like a city - numnerous conflicting subpersonalityies simultaneously live. how to harmonize the abundance of drives and impulses, and provide coordination between them? ->
