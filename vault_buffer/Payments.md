## Value

In classical economics, the value of an object or condition is the amount of discomfort/labor saved through the consumption or use of an object or condition (Labor Theory of Value).

in theory economic value is not dependent on the existence of a market - price and value are not seen as equal.

Karl Marx, for one, saw exchange value as the "form of appearance" [Erscheinungsform] of value, which implies that, although value is separate from exchange value, it is meaningless without the act of exchange.

In another classical tradition, Marx distinguished between the "value in use" (use-value, what a commodity provides to its buyer), labor cost which he calls "value" (the socially-necessary labour time it embodies), and "exchange value" (how much labor-time the sale of the commodity can claim, Smith's "labor commanded" value).

economists such as Ludwig von Mises asserted that "value" is a subjective judgment.

Prices can only be determined by taking these subjective judgments into account, and that this is done through the price mechanism in the market.

Thus, it was false to say that the economic value of a good was equal to what it cost to produce or to its current replacement cost.

___

In neoclassical economics, the value of an object or service is often seen as nothing but the price it would bring in an open and competitive market.

This is determined primarily by the demand for the object relative to supply in a perfectly competitive market.

Many neoclassical economic theories equate the value of a commodity with its price, whether the market is competitive or not.

As such, everything is seen as a commodity and if there is no market to set a price then there is no economic value.

___

The theory of value is closely related to that of allocative efficiency, the quality by which firms produce those goods and services most valued by society.

In such a case, market value has both objective and subjective components.

Economy, efficiency and effectiveness, often referred to as the "Three Es", may be used as complementary factors contributing to an assessment of the value for money provided by a purchase, project or activity.

* Economy: minimising the cost of resources used or required (inputs) – spending less;
* Efficiency: the relationship between the output from goods or services and the resources to produce them – spending well; and
* Effectiveness: the relationship between the intended and actual results of public spending (outcomes) – spending wisely.[5]

## On Value

# Summary  

Economic value is a measure of the benefit provided by a good or service to an agent.

It is generally measured through units of currency.

The interpretation is, therefore:

> what is the maximum amount of money a specific actor is willing and able to pay for the good or service?

Said another way, value is how much a desired object or condition is worth relative to other objects or conditions.

Economic values are expressed as "how much" of one desirable condition or commodity will, or would be given up in exchange for some other desired condition or commodity.

___

First, economists tried to estimate the value of a good to an individual alone, and extend that definition to goods that can be exchanged. From this analysis came the concepts [[value in use]] and [[value in exchange]].

When an economist observes an [[exchange]], two important value functions are revealed: those of the [[buyer]] and [[seller]].

Just as the buyer reveals what he is willing to pay for a certain amount of a good, so too does the seller reveal what it costs him to give up the good.

# Value Theories

There exist differing theories of value. Generally, they try to explain the exchange value or price of items.

* Why prices are as they are
* How the value of goods comes about
* How to calculate the correct price of goods and services

Examples are:

* Intrinsic theory of value

    > Things have value 'as is', by themselves.

* [[ Labor theory ]] of value ( Classical Economics)

    > the amount of labor necessary for the production of a marketable commodity, including the labor necessary for the development of any capital used in the production process

    What is being addressed are general prices - Not the specific price of a particular good or service in a given circumstance.

* the exchange theory of value ( Marxian Economics )

    >  The commodity has, at the same time, both a subjective material `use value` and a objective `exchange value` or `social value`.

* The monetary theory of value ( New Readings of Marx )

    > Money is the necessary appearance of value , in the sense that prices constitute the only form of appearance of the value of commodities.

* The Power theory of value ( Johathan Nitzan / Shimson Bichler )

    > Not possible to separate economics from politics - The quantification of power in prices is not the consequence of external laws ( be it natural or historical ), but is entirely internal to society.

    leads to some interesting dilemmas: There is, however, a causality dilemma to their argument that has drawn criticism: power is based on the ability of firms to set monopoly prices yet the ability to set prices is based on firms possessing a degree of power in the market.

* The [[ subjective theory ]] (William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Carl Menger )

    > An item value depends on the consumer wants and needs. The consumer places a value on an item by determining the marginal utility or  additional satisfaction, and decides what that means to them.

    Useful for explaining [[supply and demand]].

    Since the subjective theory takes into account the marginal utility of an item in order to put a value on it, [[marginalism]] can be applied to it. So, topics such as [[marginal utility]], [[marginal rate of substitution]], and [[opportunity costs]] are at play.

## Payment Methods

![[HistoryPayments.svg]]

1. Barter is [[exchange]] of material goods or services for other goods or services.

2. Coins: The use of coins escalated because barter sometimes posed difficulties for transactions, and certain forms of payment were perishable, so they could not be accumulated.

3. Paper money and banknotes: Their function was to replace coins, because it was uncomfortable to carry coins in large quantities.

> todo: research a bit more

4. Bills of exchange and checks: Bills of exchange date back to 12th-century Italy.

This document guaranteed that the debtor would pay the creditor or another person authorised to receive the money in the commercial document.

The origin of cheques, on the other hand, dates back to around the 18th century, and is linked to the English Crown.

5. Cards:

The first credit cards arrived in 1914, when the Western Union company created a loyalty card for its most exclusive customers, giving them access to a line of credit without surcharges.

However, only from 1958 that banks started to offer cards as a payment solution. The first card later came to be known as Visa.

## Payment Systems

## Transactions

A financial transaction is an agreement, or communication, between a buyer and seller to exchange goods, services, or assets for payment.

Any transaction involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals.[1] A financial transaction always involves one or more financial asset, most commonly money or another valuable item such as gold or silver.[2]

There are many types of financial transactions. The most common type, purchases, occur when a good, service, or other commodity is sold to a consumer in exchange for money. Most purchases are made with cash payments, including physical currency, debit cards, or cheques.[3] The other main form of payment is credit, which gives immediate access to funds in exchange for repayment at a later date.[4]

___

Payment systems may be physical or electronic and each has its own procedures and protocols. Standardization has allowed some of these systems and networks to grow to a global scale, but there are still many country-specific and product-specific systems. Examples of payment systems that have become globally available are credit card and automated teller machine (ATM) networks. Additionally, forms exist to transfer funds between financial institutions. Domestically this is accomplished by using Automated clearing house (ACH) and real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. Internationally this is accomplished using the SWIFT network.

An efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods, services, and assets. It is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy. Such failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money.[4] The technical efficiency of the payment system is important for the development of the economy.

An automated clearing house (ACH) system processes transactions in batches, storing, and transmitting them in groups. An ACH is considered a net settlement system, which means settlement may be delayed. This poses what is known as settlement risk.

Real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS) are funds transfer systems where the transfer of money or securities takes place from one bank to another on a "real-time" and on "gross" basis. Settlement in "real time" means that payment transaction does not require any waiting period. The transactions are settled as soon as they are processed. "Gross settlement" means the transaction is settled on one to one basis without bunching or netting with any other transaction. Once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.

Comparatively, ACHs are typically used for low-value, non-urgent transactions while RTGS systems are typically used for high-value, urgent transactions.[5]

Countries and regions have also implemented real-time or instant (or faster) payment systems which typically operate 24x7x365 and perform the transaction from debit of ordering customer's account to credit of beneficiary customer's account within a timeframe of 10–15 seconds.[6]

### Credit

Credit (from Latin verb credit, meaning "one believes") is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date.[1] In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people.

The resources provided may be financial (e.g. granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g. consumer credit). Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment.[2] Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower.

Bank-issued credit
Bank-issued credit makes up the largest proportion of credit in existence. The traditional view of banks as intermediaries between savers and borrowers is incorrect. Modern banking is about credit creation.[7] Credit is made up of two parts, the credit (money) and its corresponding debt, which requires repayment with interest. The majority (97% as of December 2013[7]) of the money in the UK economy is created as credit. When a bank issues credit (i.e. makes a loan), it writes a negative entry in to the liabilities column of its balance sheet, and an equivalent positive figure on the assets column; the asset being the loan repayment income stream (plus interest) from a credit-worthy individual. When the debt is fully repaid, the credit and debt are canceled, and the money disappears from the economy. Meanwhile, the debtor receives a positive cash balance (which is used to purchase something like a house), but also an equivalent negative liability to be repaid to the bank over the duration. Most of the credit created goes into the purchase of land and property, creating inflation in those markets, which is a major driver of the economic cycle.

When a bank creates credit, it effectively owes the money to itself[further explanation needed][citation needed]. If a bank issues too much bad credit (those debtors who are unable to pay it back), the bank will become insolvent; having more liabilities than assets. That the bank never had the money to lend in the first place is immaterial - the banking license affords banks to create credit - what matters is that a bank's total assets are greater than its total liabilities and that it is holding sufficient liquid assets - such as cash - to meet its obligations to its debtors. If it fails to do this it risks bankruptcy or banking license withdrawal.

There are two main forms of private credit created by banks; unsecured (non-collateralized) credit such as consumer credit cards and small unsecured loans, and secured (collateralized) credit, typically secured against the item being purchased with the money (house, boat, car, etc.). To reduce their exposure to the risk of not getting their money back (credit default), banks will tend to issue large credit sums to those deemed credit-worthy, and also to require collateral; something of equivalent value to the loan, which will be passed to the bank if the debtor fails to meet the repayment terms of the loan. In this instance, the bank uses the sale of the collateral to reduce its liabilities. Examples of secured credit include consumer mortgages used to buy houses, boats, etc., and PCP (personal contract plan) credit agreements for automobile purchases.

Movements of financial capital are normally dependent on either credit or equity transfers. The global credit market is three times the size of global equity. Credit is in turn dependent on the reputation or creditworthiness of the entity which takes responsibility for the funds. Credit is also traded in financial markets. The purest form is the credit default swap market, which is essentially a traded market in credit insurance. A credit default swap represents the price at which two parties exchange this risk – the protection seller takes the risk of default of the credit in return for a payment, commonly denoted in basis points (one basis point is 1/100 of a percent) of the notional amount to be referenced, while the protection buyer pays this premium and in the case of default of the underlying (a loan, bond or other receivable), delivers this receivable to the protection seller and receives from the seller the paramount (that is, is made whole).[citation needed]

Types
There are many types of credit, including but not limited to bank credit, commerce, consumer credit, investment credit, international credit, and public credit.

Consumer credit can be defined as "money, goods or services provided to an individual in the absence of immediate payment". Common forms of consumer credit include credit cards, store cards, motor vehicle finance, personal loans (installment loans), consumer lines of credit, payday loans, retail loans (retail installment loans) and mortgages. This is a broad definition of consumer credit and corresponds with the Bank of England's definition of "Lending to individuals". Given the size and nature of the mortgage market, many observers classify mortgage lending as a separate category of personal borrowing, and consequently, residential mortgages are excluded from some definitions of consumer credit, such as the one adopted by the U.S. Federal Reserve.[8]

The cost of credit is the additional amount, over and above the amount borrowed, that the borrower has to pay. It includes interest, arrangement fees and any other charges. Some costs are mandatory, required by the lender as an integral part of the credit agreement. Other costs, such as those for credit insurance, may be optional; the borrower chooses whether or not they are included as part of the agreement.

Interest and other charges are presented in a variety of different ways, but under many legislative regimes lenders are required to quote all mandatory charges in the form of an annual percentage rate (APR).[9] The goal of the APR calculation is to promote "truth in lending", to give potential borrowers a clear measure of the true cost of borrowing and to allow a comparison to be made between competing products. The APR is derived from the pattern of advances and repayments made during the agreement. Optional charges are usually not included in the APR calculation.[10]

### Dates

There is no evidence to support the theory that ancient civilizations worked on systems of barter. Instead, most historians believe that ancient cultures worked on principles of gift economy and debt.[5] In a gift economy, valuables are given without any formal declaration of repayment, often thought to be a form of reciprocal altruism.[6] Official systems of credit and debt were first created around 1800 BCE by the Babylonians, who established the first formal interest rate limits with the Code of Hammurabi.[7]

Between 1000 BCE and the first millennium CE, coinage became increasingly common throughout Europe and Asia.[11] In England, banknotes were introduced starting in the 17th century. Each note promised to pay the bearer the value in gold upon demand—this is called a gold standard.[12] In the 20th century, many countries gradually phased out the gold standard in favour of fiat money—money that is not backed by any commodity.[13]

### International

e-consuming to learn how to use cross-border payments tools, and how to set up processes to make optimal use of them. Solution providers (both banks and non-banks) also face challenges cobbling together old systems to meet new demands. For these providers, cross-border payments are both lucrative (especially given foreign exchange conversion revenue) and rewarding, in terms of the overall financial relationship created with the end customer.

The challenges for global payments are not simply those resulting from volume increases. A number of economic, political, and technical factors are changing the types of cross-border transactions conducted. Such factors include:

Corporations are making more cross-border purchases of services (as opposed to goods), as well as more purchases of complex fabricated parts rather than simple, raw materials.
Enterprises are purchasing from more countries, in more regions.
Increased outsourcing is leading to new in-country and new cross-border intracompany transactions.
More enterprises are participating in complex, automated supply chains, which in some cases drive automatic ordering and fulfillment. Online purchasing continues to grow, both by large enterprises as part of an automated procurement systems and by smaller enterprises purchasing directly.
There is continued growth in the use of cross-border labor.
Individuals are increasingly taking their investments abroad.
