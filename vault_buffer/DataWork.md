## Co-Occurence Matrixes

[GLCMs â€” a Great Tool for Your ML Arsenal - Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/glcms-a-great-tool-for-your-ml-arsenal-7a59f1e45b65)

Gray level co-occurence matrices

```
extract texture features from images
    
isnt this just convolutions? and the positional operator is your kernel?

whoever, it raises some good points:
    . We can calculate the entropy of a matrix 
        -sum( c[i,j] * log( c[i,j]) )
    . We can calculate the correlation of a matrix
        -sum( 
            ( i-u[i] * ( j - u[j]) * c[i,j]) /
            (theta[i] * theta[j]) 
             )
            where 
            u[k] = sum( k * c[i, j])
            theta^2[k]  = sum( (c[i , j ]  * u[k] )**2)
    . And also , the homogeneity and contrast

associated with texture == repetition of visual patterns == repetition ofcombinations fo values with a certain orientations 



separate rgb AND  hsv channels
    hsv channels are closer to how humans interpret vision 
        => Here we can put a link to that image compression video from irreducible


    assymetrical costs of classification

what i found interesting here is the transformation  from matrices to individual numbers:
    
    R-Matrix
    G-Matrix
    B-Matrix
    
    GrayScaleMatrix ( By Averaging RGB )

    H-Matrix
    S-Matrix
    V-Matrix
    
    \/ Calculate a GLCM of each , and for each glcm, compute its 4 metrics ( homogoneity , contrast, energy , correlation )
        > Which are analogous to mean, std, entropy and correlation . 
    
    7 * 4 = 28 numerical features

Pain points  around ml observability

Model and Data Drift | Unseen values for a feature
Performance Degradation | False positives increase
Data Quality Issues | Upstream data changes
Model Explainability | Explain denied transaction
Model Readiness

Performance Analysis
Drift
Data Qaulity
Explainability

Models with Fast Actuals
. We get the ground truth pretty fast -> Measure performance in production very fast.
. Challenges in PRoduction
.. Mapping back the actuals with the predictions
.. Geting the right success metrics fort your model
.. Surfacing up the right cohorts to analyze predictions

```
Going Beyond 1 Performance Metric

    Look at performance of model across various slices or cohorts of predictions
```

What about the ones where the actuals are not fast?
( Delay , Few or No Ground Truth , Biased Actuals )

```
. Use Drift as a proxy for performance
    -> Drift in predictions
    -> Drift in the features/inputs
    -> Drift in the actuals
. How to measure it?
    -> Population Stability Index
    -> Kullback-Leibler divergenge
    -> Wasserstein Distance
    -> Jensen-Shannon Distance
    -> Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
    -> Chi-Squared Test

Drifte Resolution
    . Alert 
    . Check Prediction Drift => Are the predictions drifting?
    . Check Feature Drift => Are any inputs drifting that may be causing model output drift?
    . How can the data be fixes through the targeted upsampling to improve model performance?
```

Data Quality
\=> Missing ata
\=> Invalid Data
\=> Noisy Data
\=> Duplicated Data
\=> Out of Range Violatijons
\=> Cardinality Changes
\=> Type Mismatch
\=> Unexpected Traffic

## optimization

<https://minimizingregret.wordpress.com/2016/03/02/making-second-order-methods-practical-for-machine-learning/>

usually , second order methods are too costly to be implemented in production.
. Can be show to converge to the optimium of a quadreatic function in a single iteration , but requires the calculation of the hessian and a matrix inversion, which is naively O( n^3 )
.. Usually, its better to not invert the matrix, but solve the linear system . <https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/26423/practical-example-of-why-it-is-not-good-to-invert-a-matrix>
.. Could also take an spectral approximation ( ?? ) approach to speed up inversion .

# HiveMetastore

HIve

```
Query Interface to hadoop ( HDFS)
    . Query ENgine
    . Metastore


With time, other technologies dismantled there

HDFS -> Object Storage ( AWS S3)
Map Reduce -> Spark 
Yarn -> Kubernetes
Query Engine -> Presto / Trino
```

When saving new data, we register it into hive metastore
. Maps a set of objects in the objsect store to a table exposed by hive
.. Schema of the table held in the file, with metadata
. Leads to
.. Virtualization
When using sql, not interested in the detail of object stora.

```
    .. Discoverability
    Becomes a catalog of all the collections held in object storage 
    Can also add supplemental: Update frequency, owners
    .. Schema Evolution
    Mutability is a challenge of managing data sets ; 
        Records may change over time with respect to the existing columns describing their attributes 
        The set attributes itself changes, resulting in a change to the schema
    


    .. Performance
        . Parition prunning? 
```

POssible replacements
. Difficult to install and maintain
. Not architected cloud-native, complicating managed service implementations
. Scalability 5restrictions from relational db relianceow
. No direct, but  . .. | specially because the metastore is a general interface supported by all applications.
