## BEM methodology

Block
Element
Modifier

A block is something ( What, rather than how).
An element is a component of a *block* [ not another element] that can't be disassociated from it. Is is also a "What" rather than a "how"
A Modifier is an adjective ( how, rather than what) that specifies the state or characteristics.

The nomenclature follows:
    block-name__element-name_modifier-name_modifier-value.

modifier can't be used in isolation from the modified block or element. A modifier should change the appearance, behavior, or state of the entity, not replace it.
