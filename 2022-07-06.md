If we multiply two variables of 1B cells of 64 bit floating points each (~8 GiB memory) into a third variable, then we have to traverse at least ~24 GiB of memory. If we naively assume this is sequential access (which hashmap access isnâ€™t) and we have SIMD and multi-threading, we can process that memory at a rate of 30ms / 1 GiB, or ~700ms total (and half that time if we were willing to drop to 32-bit floating points and forgo some precision!).
