Lots of computer progrmas can be solved int erms of constrained optimization.

constrainted optimization
Input

* variables
* objective
* constraints
Output: values for each xi that
* Satisfies all constraints
* Maximizes the objective

Linear Programming

* Constrained Optimization withi
* continuous variables
* constraints and objective are linear functions that is
  * f( x1, ... , xn ) = c1 *x1 + ... + cn* xn

Eg.

* NetworkFlow
* GraphTraversal
* Bipartite Matching
* Factory Production
* Electric Grid Layouts




Idea:

Search through the verrtices of the feasible reagion.

How many are there?
* At N-Dimensions, we have N-Choose-M verticies ( factorial ! )

Simplex Algorithmn:
1. Start at a vertice in the feasible region
2. Follow some constraint, repeatedly move to an uphill neighbor


StandardForm:
* Maximization objective
* <= constraints
* all variables >= 0

Converting to StandardForm:
* Minimization: Multiply F by -1
* >= contraints : Multiply F by -1
* == constraints: split into <= and >=
* LowerBound < 0 : X2 - Lb
* Unbounded: ????

Disjoint Path

* max size = N inNode to the destination

Solve this problem by translating it into an instance of maxflow.

1. Remove Edges into the origin or out of the destination
