Lots of computer progrmas can be solved int erms of constrained optimization.

constrainted optimization
Input

* variables
* objective
* constraints
Output: values for each xi that
* Satisfies all constraints
* Maximizes the objective

Linear Programming

* Constrained Optimization withi
* continuous variables
* constraints and objective are linear functions that is
  * f( x1, ... , xn ) = c1 *x1 + ... + cn* xn

Eg.

* NetworkFlow
* GraphTraversal
* Bipartite Matching
* Factory Production
* Electric Grid Layouts
